<h3><a name="RICHARD_STEELE" id="RICHARD_STEELE"><i>RICHARD STEELE.</i></a></h3>


<h4>I.</h4>


<p>It is as an essayist rather than a
dramatist that men now think of
Steele; and this is rightly so, for
his best work is to be found in
the periodical papers which he
edited. There is, however, in
his plays the same wit and humour that is to be
found in the <i>Tatler</i> and <i>Spectator</i>, and his four
comedies occupy an important position in the
history of the English drama.</p>

<p>In this Introduction it will be sufficient to give
a brief sketch of Steele's life, with especial
reference to his relations with the theatre, which
were intimate and varied.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>

<p>Richard Steele was born in Dublin in 1672;
his father was an attorney who married a widow
named Elinor Symes, but both his parents died
while he was a child, and Steele passed into the
care of a kind uncle, Henry Gascoigne, private
secretary to the Duke of Ormond, and by his
influence was placed upon the foundation of the
Charterhouse in 1684. Two years later Joseph
Addison, who was only a few weeks younger than
Steele, entered that famous school, and the two
boys formed the closest of friendships. In 1689
Steele followed Addison to Oxford, entering at
Christ Church; but in 1691 he was made a post-master
of Merton College. He would have many
introductions, for his uncle was well known at
the University, and his friend Addison was a
distinguished scholar at Magdalen. We are told
that he wrote a comedy while at college, but
burned it on being told by a friend that it was
worthless. When he left Oxford he took with
him the love of "the whole society."</p>

<p>Steele enlisted in 1694 as a private in the Duke
of Ormond's regiment of Guards. Private soldiers
in the Guards were often gentlemen's sons,
and Steele was in reality a cadet, looking forward
to the position of ensign. When Queen
Mary died in the following year he published an
anonymous poem, <i>The Procession</i>, the work of
"a gentleman of the army," and dedicated it to
Lord Cutts, Colonel of the Coldstream Guards.
He was rewarded by being made a confidential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
agent to Lord Cutts, who also obtained for him
an ensign's commission in his own regiment.
By 1700 we find Steele referred to as "Captain
Steele," and in friendly intercourse with Sir
Charles Sedley, Vanbrugh, Garth, Congreve,
and other wits. In that year, too, he fought a
duel with a Captain Kelly, "one or two of his
acquaintances having," as he says, "thought fit
to misuse him, and try their valour upon him."
The event made a serious impression upon
Steele, who, much in advance of his age, never
ceased to remonstrate in his after writings
against the "barbarous custom of duelling."</p>

<p>The life of a soldier stationed at the Tower
was certain to lead a young man of Steele's sociable,
hearty nature, into excesses. It was, as he
says, "a life exposed to much irregularity"; and
as he often did things of which he repented, he
wrote, for his own use, a little book called <i>The
Christian Hero</i>; and finding that this secret
admonition was too weak he published the
volume in 1701, with his name on the title-page.
It was "an argument proving that no principles
but those of religion are sufficient to make a
great man." A second edition was called for in
three months, but the only effect of the publication
in the regiment was "that from being reckoned
no undelightful companion he was soon
reckoned a disagreeable fellow." Under these
circumstances he says he felt it to be "incumbent
upon him to enliven his character, for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
reason he wrote the comedy called <i>The Funeral</i>,
in which (though full of incidents that move
laughter) virtue and vice appear just as they
ought to do. Nothing can make the town so
fond of a man as a successful play." Let us look
for a moment at the condition of the drama at
the opening of the eighteenth century.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>


<p>Dryden had died in 1700, and Congreve produced
his last important play in that year.
Wycherley, though still living, had long ceased
to write, but Farquhar and Vanbrugh were busy
about this time with their best work. Of other
dramatists who were then writing there are none
more important than Rowe, Dennis, Cibber,
Gildon, D'Urfey, Mrs. Manley, and Mrs. Centlivre.
The licentiousness of the Restoration
plays had been fully equalled by the coarseness
of many of those written under William III.;
and at the end of the seventeenth century a
determined protest had been made by men who
realised the evil effect of what was acted for the
amusement of the people. Jeremy Collier, a
nonjuring clergyman, led the attack by publishing,
in 1698, <i>A Short View of the Profaneness
and Immorality of the English Stage</i>. Collier
was intemperate, and there were numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
replies; but his main position was not
shaken. In the meantime proclamations were
issued against the acting of anything immoral
or irreligious, and a Society for the Reformation
of Manners was founded, which was soon
followed by similar societies in various parts
of the country.</p>

<p>In October, 1701, Steele, who says that he was
"a great admirer" of Collier's work, arranged
with Christopher Rich, of the Theatre Royal,
Drury Lane, for the production of his comedy,
<i>The Funeral, or Grief à-la-Mode</i>, as soon as they
could conveniently.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The play was acted shortly
afterwards, and it was printed in December.
In the prologue Steele said that he knew
he had numerous friends present, and that they
would show it, "and for the fellow-soldier save
the poet." The very frankness of this half-serious
appeal shows that the play did not need
artificial support, and Cibber says that it met
with "more than expected success." It is very
sprightly, but Steele did not omit, by the legitimate
use of satire, to attack the mockery of
grief by his ridicule of the undertaker, and the
mockery of justice in the person of Puzzle, the
lawyer. As in all his writings, he shows, by the
characters of Lady Sharlot and Lady Harriot,
the respect he felt for true women. "He was,"
says Thackeray, in words which are certainly
true of Steele's immediate predecessors, "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
first of our writers who really seemed to admire
and respect them." The contrast between virtue
and vice, to the advantage of the former&mdash;an
object which had not usually been aimed at by
the preceding writers of comedies&mdash;was furnished
by the character of Lady Brumpton, the widow,
whose husband was not really dead. The description
of her schemes, and her conversations
with her woman Tattleaid and her lady friends,
are admirable, and were not forgotten by Sheridan
when writing the <i>School for Scandal</i>. Tattleaid
says to the widow, "I warrant you, madam,
I'll manage 'em all; and indeed, madam, the men
are really very silly creatures, 'tis no such hard
matter. They rulers! They governors! I warrant
you, indeed!" Whereupon the widow
observes, "Ay, Tattleaid, they imagine themselves
mighty things, but government founded
on force only is a brutal power. We rule them
by their affections, which blinds them into belief
that they rule us, or at least are in the government
with us. But in this nation our power is
absolute." The conversation in the last act,
when the widow is preparing for the funeral, and
Tattleaid has her mouth full of pins, is equally
clever.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to find better comedy than
the instructions of Sable, the undertaker, to his
men: "Let's have no laughing, now, on any
provocation [<i>makes faces</i>]. Look yonder, that hale,
well-looking puppy! You ungrateful scoundrel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
did not I pity you, take you out of a great man's
service, and show you the pleasure of receiving
wages? Did not I give you ten, then fifteen,
now twenty shillings a week, to be sorrowful?
and the more I give you, I think, the gladder you
are." And again, "Look you, now, you are all
upon the sneer; let me have none but downright
stupid countenances.... Ye stupid rogues,
whom I have picked out of all the rubbish of
mankind, and fed for your eminent worthlessness,
attend, and know that I speak you this moment
stiff and immutable to all sense of noise, mirth,
or laughter [<i>makes mouths at them as they pass by
him to bring them to a constant countenance</i>]. So,
they are pretty well&mdash;pretty well." Excellent,
too, is the talk of the lawyer and his clerk: "I
hope to see the day when the indenture shall be
the exact measure of the land that passes by it;
for 'tis a discouragement to the gown that every
ignorant rogue of an heir should in a word or two
understand his father's meaning, and hold ten
acres of land by half an acre of parchment."
There is an admirable dialogue about their
lovers between Lady Sharlot and Lady Harriot,
in the second act, and in the fourth act Steele's
comrades would be delighted with the talk of the
soldiers, one of whom had saved an officer's life,
but had now been whipped from constable to
constable all the way from Cornwall to London.
"That's due by the courtesy of England to all
that want in red coats; besides, there's an Act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
that makes us free of all Corporations, and that's
the ceremony of it." When Tatter says, "In our
last clothing in the regiment I served in afore,
the colonel had one shirt afore, the agent one
behind, and every captain of the regiment a
button," Lord Hardy, smiling, replies, "Hush,
you rogue, you talk mutiny," and his Lordship's
man at once gives the soldier a blow on the
head: "Ay, sirrah, what have you to do with
more knowledge than that of your right hand
from your left?" But later on Trim remarks that
"after all, 'tis upon the neck of such scoundrels
as these gentlemen that we great captains build
our renown."</p>

<p>There are obvious weak points in the plot,
notably the introduction of bigamy on Lady
Brumpton's part, in order to remove the difficulty
about the will made by Lord Brumpton in her
favour. There was, of course, nothing to prevent
the Earl executing a fresh will when he
again came to life, after finding out his wife's
true character. For the rest, we may refer to
an interesting contemporary criticism in Charles
Gildon's little book, <i>A Comparison between the
Two Stages</i>, published in April, 1702, in the form
of a dialogue between Ramble, Sullen, and
Chagrin, a critic. When Ramble proposes to
speak of <i>The Funeral</i>, Sullen says, "'Tis a
dangerous matter to talk of this play; the Town
has given it such applause, 'twill be an ungrateful
undertaking to call their judgments in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
question." He agrees that it is diverting, and
written with noble intentions. Ramble remarks,
"I hear the gentleman is a fine companion, and
passes for a wit of the first rank;" but Sullen
and the Critic agree that <i>The Funeral</i> is not a
just comedy, the principle being much amiss.
They argue that Lord Brumpton could not, as
was supposed, have lain dead in the house so
long, and no one see him; while intrigues and
amours were going on in the meantime in the
house of death. It is farce, not comedy. Look
at the manner of Lady Sharlot's escape in the
coffin&mdash;a forced situation which was quite unnecessary.
Is it likely that a man of Cabinet's
wickedness would have been frightened into a
confession by a ghost? The undertaker is not
adequately punished; for he was paid anyhow.
Nevertheless, the satire on some widows, and on
undertakers, is happy. The Critic thinks the
language "too concise and stiff" for comedy;
see, for example, the scene between Lord
Brumpton and Trusty in Act I., and that between
Trusty and Cabinet in Act IV. There
are difficult lines in the Preface, and long parentheses
in the play. Ramble turns round and
asks, "Did you ever read <i>The Christian Hero</i>?"
The Critic says, "Yes; what do you mean by
asking me?" Ramble replies, "Pray don't be
angry. Is it not an extraordinary thing?"
The answer is, "Look ye, Sir&mdash;to answer you
dogmatically, and in a few words&mdash;No." Critic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
gives reasons: "Thus, then, briefly: 'Tis a
chaos, 'tis a confusion of thoughts, rude and
undigested; though he had the advice of an
ingenious man to put it into method. 'Tis
dated from the Tower-guard, as a present to his
Colonel, that his Colonel might think him, even
in time of duty, a very contemplative soldier,
and, I suppose, by the roughness of the style,
he writ it there, on the butt-end of a musket."
Sullen replies, "Hush! no reproaches; the
gentleman has done very well, and chose a
worthy subject," and Ramble adds, "It bore
two editions." The Critic rejoins, "It did not;
it was but once printed, nor is all that impression
sold; 'tis a trick of the booksellers to get it
off."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Ramble, however, maintains his good
opinion of the author. The discussion of <i>The
Funeral</i> is then resumed; and Ramble suggests
that, in the opening of Act III., Mademoiselle's
"promises" is a mistake for "premises." The
Critic objects, among other things, to the use of
the word "bagatelle." And then Sullen turns
to the merits of the play&mdash;the characters, the
visiting scene, the incidents, all flowing naturally,
and the moral, which is the true result of
the piece. Ramble adds warm praises of the
author&mdash;who is described as "indued with singular
honesty, a noble disposition, and a conformity
of good manners"&mdash;and his works, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
the Critic hopes, if he will divert the town with
another play, that it may be more "correct."
The author does not want understanding.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>


<p>Steele says that <i>The Funeral</i>, "with some
particulars enlarged upon to his advantage,"
had obtained for him the notice of the king, and
that "his name, to be provided for, was in the
last table-book ever worn by the glorious and
immortal William the Third." He was, however,
disappointed, for King William died in
March, 1702. But about that time Steele was
made a Captain of Foot in a new regiment
whose Colonel was Lord Lucas, whom Steele
had known at the Tower. Each officer raised a
company, and Steele was sent to Landguard
Fort, opposite Harwich, where he did everything
in his power for the good of the men
under him. At the end of the year, or at the
beginning of 1703, he agreed to sell to Christopher
Rich a comedy, which was nearly finished,
called <i>The Election of Gotham</i>. Of that play
nothing further is known; but Steele obtained
£72 from Rich, to be repaid in March.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Rich
said that Steele was in want of money and in
danger of arrest, and it is a fact that the first of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
a long series of actions for debt had some time
before been commenced against him. Steele,
however, said that the money was paid to induce
him to write more, and upon condition that he
should bring his next play to Rich, whom he
charged with oppression and extortion. We
shall hear more of this quarrel.</p>

<p>Complaints against the immorality of the
stage increased in number. In 1702 Queen
Anne directed that certain actors at Lincoln's
Inn Fields should be prosecuted, and they were
found guilty of "uttering impious, lewd, and
immoral expressions." Collier wrote <i>A Dissuasive
from the Play House</i>, which was answered
by Dennis, and the Lord Chamberlain ordered
that all plays must be licensed by the Master of
the Revels, who was not to pass anything not
strictly agreeable to religion and good manners.
At that time, it should be remembered, the play
began about five, and ended at eight, "for the
convenience of the Qualities resorting to the
Park after." Such was the condition of affairs
when Steele's second comedy, <i>The Lying Lover,
or the Ladies' Friendship</i>, was produced, in
December, 1703, to run for six nights.</p>

<p>In his <i>Apology</i> Steele afterwards wrote of the
<i>Lying Lover</i>:&mdash;"Mr. Collier had, about the time
wherein this was published, written against the
immorality of the stage. I was (as far as I
durst for fear of witty men, upon whom he had
been too severe) a great admirer of his work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
and took it into my head to write a comedy in
the severity he required. In this play I make
the spark or hero kill a man in his drink, and
finding himself in prison the next morning, I
give him the contrition which he ought to have
on that occasion.... I can't tell, sir, what
they would have me do to prove me a Churchman;
but I think I have appeared one even in
so trifling a thing as a comedy; and considering
me as a comic poet, I have been a martyr and
confessor for the Church; for this play was
damned for its piety." In the Dedication of the
play to the Duke of Ormond, he says, "The
design of it is to banish out of conversation all
entertainment which does not proceed from
simplicity of mind, good nature, friendship, and
honour;" and in the Preface he again refers to
the manner in which the English stage had
offended against the laws of morals and religion;
"I thought, therefore, it would be an
honest ambition to attempt a comedy which
might be no improper entertainment in a Christian
commonwealth." He admits that the anguish
and sorrow in the prison scene "are,
perhaps, an injury to the rules of comedy; but I
am sure they are a justice to those of morality."
It was to be hoped that wit would now recover
from its apostacy, for the Queen had "taken the
stage under her consideration."</p>

<p>The play was based upon Corneille's <i>Le
Menteur</i>, but the latter and more serious portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
is entirely Steele's. Alarcon, from whom Corneille
borrowed, made his liar marry a girl he
did not care for instead of the one he loved;
Corneille made the liar's love change, so that
his marriage met his wishes; while Steele
represents Bookwit's inveterate love of romancing,
generally in self-glorification, as leading to
a duel with Penelope's lover, and to his own
imprisonment in Newgate. This trouble teaches
him the necessary lesson, and the hope is held
out to him, at the end, of the hand of Penelope's
friend, Victoria. "There is no gallantry in love
but truth," are his last words.</p>

<p>There are many amusing passages in the
<i>Lying Lover</i>, and young Bookwit is very entertaining
in the earlier acts, especially in his
boastful account to the ladies of his imaginary
campaigns:&mdash;"There's an intimate of mine,
a general officer, who has often said, 'Tom,
if thou would'st but stick to any one application,
thou might'st be anything.' 'Tis my misfortune,
madam, to have a mind too extensive." In the
second act there is a pleasant account of "the
pretty merchants and their dealers" at the New
Exchange, where Bookwit was bewildered by
the darts and glances against which he was not
impregnable; and in the third act, Penelope
and Victoria, who are both fascinated by the
young liar, be-patch and be-powder each other
in the hope of making their rival ugly, while
they profess&mdash;like their maids&mdash;to be on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
closest terms of friendship. In the fourth act,
after the duel, the constable remarks, "Sir, what
were you running so fast for? There's a man
killed in the garden, and you're a fine gentleman,
and it must be you&mdash;for good honest
people only beat one another." And there is an
admirable scene in Newgate, where Bookwit is
received with respect by highwaymen and others
because he is supposed to have killed a man.
An alchemist&mdash;"the ignorant will needs call it
coining"&mdash;who is about to be hung, says, "Yet
let me tell you, sir, because by secret sympathy
I'm yours, I must acquaint you, if you can obtain
the favour of an opportunity and a crucible, I
can show projection&mdash;directly Sol, sir, Sol, sir,
more bright than that high luminary the Latins
called so&mdash;wealth shall be yours; we'll turn
every bar about us into golden ingots.&mdash;Sir, can
you lend me half-a-crown?"</p>

<p>It is only in the last act that art is sacrificed
to the moral purpose that Steele had in his view.
The ladies repent of their mutual plottings; and
Bookwit, who believes that he has killed his
opponent, looks forward to death, and makes
many solemn speeches, printed in blank verse,
which will to a great extent account for the
failure of the piece. Bookwit's father is broken-hearted;
and a friend heroically declares that
it was he, and not Bookwit, who killed Lovemore;
whereupon Lovemore says, "I can hold
out no longer," and brings matters to a happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
ending by explaining that he had in reality
been only slightly wounded. Hazlitt's words
respecting Steele's plays are truer of the <i>Lying
Lover</i> than of the rest: "It is almost a misnomer
to call them comedies; they are rather
homilies in dialogues." But even in this piece
there is, as we have seen, nothing that can properly
be called homily except at the close.
Ward has described the play more accurately,
as "the first instance of sentimental comedy
proper. It is attempted to produce an effect,
not by making vice and folly ridiculous, but by
moving compassion."</p>

<p>It was Steele, rather than young Bookwit, who
says in the first scene, "I don't know how to express
myself&mdash;but a woman, methinks, is a being
between us and angels. She has something in her
that at the same time gives awe and invitation;
and I swear to you, I was never out in't yet, but
I always judged of men as I observed they judged
of women: there is nothing shows a man so
much as the object of his affections."</p>


<h4>IV.</h4>


<p>The battle of Blenheim was won in August,
1704, and in December Addison obtained fame
and office by his poem <i>The Campaign</i>. Steele,
who was in constant intercourse with him, said
in after years that Addison, in spite of his bashfulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
and modesty, "was above all men in
that talent we call humour." At the various
coffee-houses, and especially at the Kitcat Club,
the friends met all the famous wits of the day.
Steele endeavoured, in 1704, without success,
to increase his income by obtaining a troop in
a regiment of Dragoons, which the Duke of
Ormond was about to raise. Next year Lord
Lucas died, and Steele's connection with the
army appears to have been severed not long
afterwards.</p>

<p>In March, 1705, Steele's third play, <i>The Tender
Husband; or, the Accomplished Fools</i>, was given
to Rich, and it was acted in April and published
in May. The early writers on the subject constantly
stated that <i>The Tender Husband</i> appeared
in 1703, and was followed by <i>The Lying Lover</i>,
and they then explained that the failure of the
latter piece caused Steele to abandon play-writing
for many years. In reality, however,
<i>The Lying Lover</i> was the earlier play of the two
by more than a year.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><i>The Tender Husband</i> ran for five nights, but
was not a financial success. Addison wrote the
Prologue and assisted in the play itself, and to
Addison it was dedicated, though, as Steele
said, his friend would "be surprised, in the
midst of a daily and familiar conversation, with
an address which bears so distant an air as a
public Dedication." "My purpose in this application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
is only to show the esteem I have for you,
and that I look upon my intimacy with you as one
of the most valuable enjoyments of my life." The
reception given to the play was such "as to make
me think it no improper Memorial of an inviolable
friendship." In the last number of the original
series of the <i>Spectator</i>, Steele afterwards wrote:&mdash;"I
remember when I finished <i>The Tender Husband</i>,
I told him there was nothing I so ardently
wished as that we might sometime or other publish
a work written by us both, which should
bear the name of <i>The Monument</i>, in memory of
our friendship. I heartily wish what I have done
here were as honorary to that sacred name, as
learning, wit, and humanity render those pieces
which I have taught the reader how to distinguish
for his. When the play above-mentioned
was last acted, there were so many
applauded strokes in it which I had from the
same hand, that I thought very meanly of myself
that I had never publicly acknowledged
them."</p>

<p>Warned by the fate of <i>The Lying Lover</i>,
Steele seems to have determined that there
must be less sermonising in the new play. The
result is that <i>The Tender Husband</i> is, as a whole,
very amusing; but unfortunately a second plot&mdash;alluded
to in the title&mdash;is woven into the
story which gives to the play its interest; and
as this account of the manner in which the
"tender husband" tries the faithfulness of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
foolish wife by means of his mistress, disguised
as a man, is unwholesome in tone and unnatural,
it spoils what would otherwise be an excellent
farcical comedy, and at the same time has no
real connection with the rest of the play. Fortunately,
however, Mrs. Clerimont's weaknesses
are hardly brought before the spectator except
in the first scene and the last act. The rest of
the piece describes the love affairs of Biddy
Tipkin, a banker's niece&mdash;acted by the charming
Mrs. Oldfield&mdash;whose head has been so completely
filled with the romances which she has
read that she begs to be called Parthenissa:&mdash;"If
you ask my name, I must confess you put
me upon revealing what I always keep as the
greatest secret I have&mdash;for, would you believe
it, they have called me&mdash;I don't know how to
own it, but they have called me&mdash;Bridget." To
her aunt she says, "Do you think that I can
ever marry a man that's true and hearty? What
a peasant-like amour do these coarse words
impart?... Good madam, don't upbraid me
with my mother Bridget, and an excellent
housewife." She longs for a lover who will be
associated with disguise, serenade, and adventure;
and as she is an heiress, Captain Clerimont&mdash;the
usual gentlemanly adventurer of seventeenth
century comedy&mdash;is willing to humour
her whims, and he is so successful that, though
she is of opinion that "a lover should sigh in
private, and languish whole years before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
reveals his passion; he should retire into some
solitary grove, and make the woods and wild
beasts his confidants," yet she is soon able to
admit "I am almost of opinion that had Oroondates
been as pressing as Clerimont, <i>Cassandra</i>
had been but a pocket-book: but it looks so ordinary
to go out at a door to be married&mdash;indeed
I ought to be taken out of a window, and run
away with." Biddy Tipkin is the direct prototype
of Sheridan's Lydia Languish, and Goldsmith
was equally indebted to Biddy's cousin,
Humphry Gubbin, for the idea of Tony Lumpkin.
This booby son of an old-fashioned squire&mdash;the
forerunner of Fielding's Squire Western&mdash;is
as amusing as Biddy, whom his father wishes
him to marry. Humphry, however, had scruples,
and "boggled a little" at marrying so near
a relation as a cousin. His father had been in
the habit of beating him like a child, and it was
not till he came to town that he knew he was of
age, or what was his fortune. Mr. Pounce, a
lawyer, anxious to secure Biddy for Captain
Clerimont, advises Humphry not to be fooled
any longer; and when Humphry remarks,
"To tell you truly, I took an antipathy to my
cousin ever since my father proposed her to me;
and since everybody knows I came up to be
married, I don't care to go down and look
baulked," Pounce seizes the opportunity of providing
for his sister Mrs. Fairlove, the mistress
of the elder Clerimont. Biddy and Humphry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>
having explained their feelings to each other,
Humphry says, "I'll find out a way for us to
get rid of one another, and deceive the old folks
that would couple us;" but when Biddy replies,
"This wears the face of an amour&mdash;there is
something in that thought which makes thy
presence less insupportable," he exclaims,
"Nay, nay, now you're growing fond; if you
come with these maids' tricks to say you hate
at first and afterwards like me, you'll spoil the
whole design."</p>

<p>Other characters, such as Biddy's "Urganda
of an Aunt," who is not free from notions of
romance on her own account, Pounce the disreputable
lawyer, Sir Harry Gubbin, and Captain
Clerimont, who obtains access to Biddy by
disguising himself as a painter&mdash;an idea borrowed
from Molière's <i>Le Sicilien</i>&mdash;add to the
amusement of the piece; and then there are
smart sayings in abundance, such as the elder
Clerimont's: "I don't design you to personate
a real man, but only a pretty gentleman;" or
Pounce's: "Oh, dear sir, a fine lady's clothes
are not old by being worn, but by being seen."
These merits render the weakness of the ending
the more regrettable. The moral is obvious:
wife or son should be restrained only by generous
bonds, for "wives to obey must love, children
revere." If any one, after reading the episode of
the elder Clerimont and his wife, is surprised at
Steele's statement that he had "been very careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>
to avoid everything that might look ill-natured,
immoral, or prejudicial to what the
better part of mankind hold sacred and honourable,"
it should be remembered that in Steele's
play a repentant wife is forgiven by her husband,
whose own conduct was far from blameless,
while in the comedies of his predecessors it was
common for the wife to hoodwink her steadygoing
husband triumphantly. Compared with
such plays Steele's work is harmless, and even
moral, in its intention.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say which were the "applauded
strokes" contributed by Addison to
<i>The Tender Husband</i>. Some writers, bearing in
mind the Tory Foxhunter of the <i>Freeholder</i>, have
attributed to Addison the character of Sir Harry
Gubbin; others, remembering the description of
a lady's library in the <i>Spectator</i>, have suggested
that his hand is to be found in the description of
Biddy Tipkin; and some, again, have thought
that he was concerned rather in the serious
portions of the play. Perhaps Addison's help
consisted more in general hints given while the
piece was under revision than in the contribution
of any special portion. But speculation is
vain in this matter. Addison and Steele were
friends who were wont to work together without
any jealous thought as to the exact share which
each of them contributed.</p>

<p>It will be convenient to notice here a Chancery
suit which arose out of Steele's arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>
with Christopher Rich, of the Drury Lane
Theatre, respecting the production of his plays.
Steele was the complainant, and in his bill,
dated 1707, he said that about December, 1702,
Rich paid him £72 on the understanding that
Steele would write for him another play. Steele
gave a bond of £144; and in 1705 furnished
Rich with <i>The Tender Husband</i>, which was acted
on the condition that the author was to have the
profits of two days' acting in the autumn. The
profits exceeded £72, but Rich would not pay
over the balance, and commenced an action for
the £144. Steele, therefore prayed that these
proceedings might be stayed by injunction.</p>

<p>Rich, in his reply, said that the terms of the
agreement for the production of <i>The Funeral</i>
having been carried out to Steele's satisfaction,
Steele agreed, in January, 1703, to give Rich
a new play, and at the same time borrowed £72,
to be repaid with interest in March, upon pain
of the forfeiture of £144. Steele did not pay; but
in 1705 he produced <i>The Tender Husband</i>. The
profits, however, were so small that £10 8s. 2d.
was all that, according to the agreement, Rich
was called upon to pay as the result of the first
four days' acting. Steele agreed that this sum
should go to the use of the company, and that
the play should be acted for his benefit once in
the following winter. The performance took
place in November, though Steele at the last
objected that there would not be a sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>
good audience. The treasurer was told to give
Steele the balance £2 17s. 6d., which resulted
from this performance, together with the
£10 8s. 2d. already mentioned; but Steele
neglected or refused to take the money. Rich
added that the play had been acted several
times at the Haymarket Theatre without his
consent&mdash;which was quite true; and he prayed
that this action might be dismissed, with costs.</p>

<p>There is no further record of the case until
April 29, 1710, when Rich's counsel showed
that his client had submitted an answer to the
plaintiff's bill on January 27, 1708, and that
Steele had since then taken no action. The
Court thereupon ordered that the bill should be
dismissed, with costs, which were to be taxed.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
The pleadings, which contain much that is of
interest to the student of theatrical history, are
given in full in the Appendix.</p>


<h4>V.</h4>


<p>In the earlier part of 1705, probably soon
after the production of <i>The Tender Husband</i>,
Steele married a widow, Margaret Stretch, whose
maiden name was Ford. This lady belonged to
a good family in Barbados; and her brother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>
Major Robert Ford, who made his will in December,
1704, left to her the residue of his
property. He was then about to sail for England,
and within a few weeks he was taken
prisoner by a French privateer, and died on the
high seas. In March, 1705, his sister took out
letters of administration, and soon afterwards
she was married to Steele, who subsequently
wrote to the mother of the lady who was to be
his second wife: "My late wife had so extreme
a value for me that she, by fine, conveyed to me
her whole estate situate in Barbados, which,
with the stock and slaves (proper security being
given for the rent), is let at £850 per annum, at
half yearly payments, that is to say, £425 each
first of May, and £425 each first of December.
This estate came to her encumbered with a debt
of £3,000, by legacies and debts of her brother,
whose executrix she was as well as heiress."</p>

<p>In January, 1707, we find Steele administering
to the property of his wife, who had died in
December. Mary Scurlock, of whom we shall
hear immediately, was at the funeral. There is
no source of information respecting the deceased
lady, except the writings of the scandalous Mrs.
Manley, who had quarrelled with Steele, but
certainly knew something of the facts, if she
chose to speak the truth. Her statement is that
Steele had embarked in alchemy, and had been
ruined by a rogue who cheated him, when he
found an opportunity of repairing his fortunes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
by marrying a rich but elderly lady. Hints are
thrown out that an odd misfortune, occasioned
by Steele's sister, was the cause of his wife's
death; and that he found consolation in "a
younger wife, and a cry'd up beauty." It is true
that Steele had a sister who was mad; but his
second wife, who knew the facts, was willing to
marry him in a few months, which she would
hardly have done if there had been any suspicious
circumstances connected with her friend's
death. Possibly, however, the end was accelerated
by some fright. There can be no doubt
that Steele's sanguine nature had led him, at a
period not exactly defined, to experiment with
the crucible, in the hope of discovering the oft-sought-for
<i>aurum potabile</i>. When he wrote the
scene in the <i>Lying Lover</i>, in which Charcoal
appears, he would seem to have discovered the
absurdity of his study of occult science.</p>

<p>In a prologue to Vanbrugh's <i>The Mistake</i>,
acted at the new theatre in the Haymarket on
December 27, 1705, Steele satirised the popular
demand for dresses, music, and dancing: "If
'tis a comedy, you ask&mdash;Who dance?" In
August, 1706, he was appointed gentleman-writer
to Prince George of Denmark, with a
salary of £100 a year, "not subject to taxes."
In the course of the following year he contributed
verses to a new monthly paper called <i>The Muses'
Mercury</i>, and the first number (January, 1707)
contained a reference to Mrs. Steele:&mdash;"Had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span>
the death of a dear friend hindered Captain
Steele from finishing a comedy of his, it would
also have been acted this season." We shall see
that in the years that followed Steele often contemplated
the production of another play, but
was no doubt prevented by his numerous other
occupations. He was appointed Gazetteer by
Robert Harley, on Arthur Maynwaring's recommendation,
in April or May, with a salary of
£300, liable to a tax of £45, and he endeavoured
to obey "the rule observed by all Ministries, to
keep that paper very innocent and very insipid";
but, inevitably, there were often complaints either
about what was inserted or what was omitted.</p>

<p><i>The Muses' Mercury</i> for September contained
the following paragraph:&mdash;"As for comedies,
there's no great expectation of anything of that
kind since Mr. Farquhar's death: the two gentlemen
who could probably always succeed in
the comic vein, Mr. Congreve and Captain Steele,
having affairs of much greater importance to
take up their time and thoughts." In that
month Steele married Mary Scurlock, a lady of
twenty-eight years of age, and heiress to the
late Jonathan Scurlock, of Carmarthen, who was
descended from an ancient Irish family. Her
estate was worth £400 a year, but there was a
demand upon it of £1,400. Mary Scurlock had,
as we have seen, known her husband's first wife,
but the courtship does not seem to have begun
until August. The lady saved all Steele's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>
letters, both then and during her married life.
He begged that they might be shown to no man,
as others could not judge of "so delicate a circumstance
as the commerce between man and
wife"; but half a century after his death the
whole were published, and these letters form one
of the most interesting studies in existence. The
charming notes to "dear Prue"&mdash;often sent daily,
and sometimes more frequently, from wherever
he might happen to be engaged&mdash;show us the
writer's inmost feelings, and in spite of his
obvious weaknesses he comes well out of the
ordeal. He loved his wife and children to the
end, and if he was careless and constantly in
debt, "Prue" was somewhat strait-laced and
exacting. It should never be forgotten that we
have but two or three of her replies. The letters
written during the love-making are delightful,
and Steele himself printed some of them in the
<i>Tatler</i> and <i>Spectator</i>. The young lady was not
without experience, for three years earlier a
"wretched impudence," named Henry Owen,
had brought an unsuccessful suit against her for
breach of contract of marriage. That she was
much in love with Steele is evident from a letter
of hers to her mother, in which she praised his
richly-endowed mind, his person, his temper, his
understanding, and his morals. It was her "first
and only inclination," and she was sure that she
should "never meet with a prospect of happiness
if this should vanish." Miss Scurlock, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>
something of the prude in her, desired that
the marriage should be secret, and would not
have it known until her mother's consent had
been received. Before the end of the year Steele
had taken a house in Bury Street, which was
conveniently near to St. James's church, whither
his wife frequently resorted. Steele's own prayers,
written before and after marriage for his
private use, show the manly religion which was
the foundation of his character.</p>

<p>Apologies for absence from home were soon
necessitated by engagements of one kind or
another. This was the kind of note which Steele
often sent to his "absolute governess":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Devil Tavern, Temple Bar,<br />
<i>Jan.</i> 3<i>d.</i> 1708.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Prue</span>,</p>

<p>"I have partly succeeded in my business
to-day, and enclose two guineas as an earnest of
more. Dear Prue, I can't come home to dinner.
I languish for your welfare, and will never be a
moment careless more.</p>

<p>"Your faithful husband,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">R. Steele</span>.</p>

<p>"Send me word you have received this."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Barbados property, which was necessarily
left to the care of an agent, gave much trouble, and
it is clear that Steele's views as to the probable
income to be derived from that and other sources
was very rose-coloured. He was frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>
embarrassed, but one debt usually arose from a
habit of borrowing money to pay off another
creditor, and the actual amount owing at any
time seems never to have been very large. Mrs.
Steele was not always on good terms with her
mother, and on one occasion that lady proposed
to settle a portion of her property on Steele and
his wife jointly, and to make the whole estate
liable to a charge in his favour in case he outlived
his wife without issue. This Steele declined,
begging that the whole of whatever was left to
them might be fixed on his wife and her posterity.</p>


<h4>VI.</h4>


<p>Swift returned to England in November, 1707,
and was soon in frequent intercourse with Steele
and Addison. In March, 1708, he published his
famous "Predictions for the year 1708, by Isaac
Bickerstaff, Esq.," an attack on an astrologer
and almanack-maker, John Partridge. In this
pamphlet Swift declared that he, unlike others,
was a real astrologer, and prophesied that Partridge
would die on March 29. On the 30th of
that month another pamphlet appeared, giving a
circumstantial account of Partridge's death. The
almanack-maker protested that he was as well
as ever; but Swift replied that it was evident
that the man was dead, because no man living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>
could write such rubbish as was contained in the
new almanack for 1709. Other wits joined in the
controversy, and when Steele began <i>The Tatler</i>
he adopted the name of "Isaac Bickerstaff,"
which, he said, Swift had made famous through
all parts of Europe.</p>

<p>Steele obtained a house at Hampton Wick,
and there his "dear ruler" was established in
1708, with a chariot and two or four horses, a
saddle-horse, a footman, a gardener, a boy Will,
her own woman, and a boy who could speak
Welsh. "I shall make it the business of my life,"
wrote Steele, "to make you easy and happy:
consult your cool thoughts and you'll know that
'tis the glory of a woman to be her husband's
friend and companion, and not his sovereign
director." In another letter he said, "It is not
in your power to make me otherwise than your
affectionate, faithful, and tender husband." With
yet another note he sent "seven pen'orth of
walnuts at five a penny, which is the greatest
proof I can give you at present of my being,
with my whole heart, yours," &amp;c. Outside the
letter he added, below the address, "There are
but 29 walnuts." In October he lost a place
through the death of Prince George, but the
Queen gave him a pension of £100 a-year. Debts,
however, were numerous, and an execution was
put in on account of arrears of rent for the house
in Bury Street. When Addison was made
Secretary to Lord Wharton, the new Viceroy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>
Ireland, Steele hoped to get an Under-secretaryship,
but was disappointed. In March, 1709, his
eldest daughter, Elizabeth, was born, and had
for godfathers Addison and Mr. Wortley Montagu.
In the following month Steele began the
great work of his life.</p>

<p>The periodical literature of the day was of little
value. The few papers that existed were either
brief news-sheets, or were repositories for questions
and answers, supplied by the readers, and
of feeble verse. The only periodical which was in
any sense a forerunner of the <i>Tatler</i> was Defoe's
<i>Review</i>, in which part of the space was set apart
for "Advice from the Scandalous Club," where
men, not parties, and things rather than persons,
were censured. When the quantity of matter
was too great for the available space, a monthly
"Supplementary Journal" was published. Afterwards
Defoe gave a friendly greeting to Steele's
new work, which dealt with the social questions
and follies of the day in a style that was more
thorough, and at the same time more genial, than
his own.</p>

<p>The first number of the <i>Tatler</i> was published
on April 22, 1709, and it appeared three times a
week. It was a single folio sheet, price one
penny, and four numbers were given away
gratuitously. The reader found there items of
news, accounts of popular entertainments, poetry,
and learning. As time went on the news articles
were dropped, and each number was gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span>
confined to one subject. Isaac Bickerstaff was
described as "an old man, a philosopher, a
humourist, an astrologer, and a censor." The
other characters described from time to time are
not essential to the general plan of the paper.
"The general purpose of the whole," as Steele
wrote at the close, "has been to recommend
truth, innocence, honour, and virtue, as the chief
ornaments of life." He was satisfied if one vice
had been destroyed, or a morning's cheerfulness
given to an honest mind. As censor he thought
fit to speak under a mask, because he knew that
his own life was "at best but pardonable."</p>

<p>Addison rendered much valuable aid, which
Steele acknowledged in such generous terms that
some writers have represented that all that was
valuable in the paper was by his friend. The fact,
however, is that of the 271 numbers that appeared
about 188 were by Steele, and only 42 by Addison,
while 36 were written by them jointly.
Steele started the paper, and Addison knew
nothing of the authorship until six numbers had
appeared, and did not render any material assistance
during the early months of publication.
The aid given by Swift and others is too slight
to need mention. Steele had to write, whether he
was prepared or not, whenever he had no paper
by anyone else ready; but his most careless
contributions are interesting, because he wrote
from the heart, and was a man full of kindly
impulse. It is sufficient to remark here that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>
the articles on public amusements he provided
admirable criticisms, and was always ready to
assist a good actor. Years afterwards Cibber
wrote that during a season of depression excellent
audiences had often been drawn together at
a day's notice by the influence of a single <i>Tatler</i>.
Steele was much in advance of his time in the
way in which he quoted and appreciated Shakespeare
and Milton. As Gay said, he rescued
learning "out of the hands of pedants and fools,
and discovered the true method of making it
amiable and lovely to all mankind."</p>

<p>Steele's income was increased by £300 a year
in January, 1710, when he was appointed a
Commissioner of the Stamp Office. At that time
there was great excitement about the pending
trial of the Tory, Dr. Sacheverell, two of whose
sermons were condemned as seditious libels,
reflecting on the Queen, the Revolution, and the
Protestant succession. Sacheverell was found
guilty in March and forbidden to preach for
three years, but the sentence was nominal, and
the Tories were in reality triumphant. In June
Sunderland, the Duke of Marlborough's son-in-law,
was dismissed, and in August Godolphin
was called upon to give up the seals, and Harley
became Chancellor of the Exchequer, and practically
head of the Government. Papers satirising
Harley had appeared in the <i>Tatler</i> in July,
and on September 10 Swift, who had just returned
to England, wrote to Esther Johnson, "Steele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>
will certainly lose his Gazetteer's place, all the
world detesting his engaging in politics." A
few days later Whig statesmen were turned out
in favour of the Earl of Rochester, the Duke of
Buckingham, and Henry St. John, and in October
Steele was deprived of his place, or, as Swift
afterwards stated, resigned to avoid being discarded.</p>

<p>The Tory <i>Examiner</i> had been established in
August; in November Swift contributed his
first paper. He still met Addison and Steele as
friends, but not so often as formerly, and he says
he intervened with Harley in favour of Steele's
retention of his office of Commissioner. The
Ministry were by no means desirous of quarrelling
with a popular writer, and Steele kept this
post until 1713. The <i>Tatler</i> came to a sudden
end on January 2, 1711, perhaps as the result of
a compact with the Government. Even Addison
appears not to have been consulted when this
step was taken.</p>


<h4>VII.</h4>


<p>It was commonly said that Steele had given
up the <i>Tatler</i> through want of matter. How
entirely erroneous this statement was is shown
by the appearance, two months later (March 1,
1711), of the first number of the <i>Spectator</i>, which
was issued daily until December 6, 1712. Addison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span>
commenced it with a description of the
Spectator himself; in the second number Steele
gave an account of the club where the plan of
the work was supposed to be arranged, and drew
the first sketch of its members&mdash;Sir Roger de
Coverley, the country gentleman; Sir Andrew
Freeport, the merchant; Captain Sentry, the
soldier; Will Honeycomb, the fine gentleman
about town; and the clergyman. The most
important of the papers relating to Sir Roger de
Coverley are by Addison, who was at his best
in the <i>Spectator</i>, of which he wrote 274 numbers,
while Steele was responsible for 236. The world,
however, owes Addison to Steele, who rightly
said, "I claim to myself the merit of having extorted
excellent productions from a person of the
greatest abilities, who would not have let them
appear by any other means." Even Swift wrote
that Steele seemed to have gathered new life, and
to have a new fund of wit. Until the passing of
the Stamp Act in August, 1712, when the price
was necessarily raised, the circulation seems to
have been nearly 4,000.</p>

<p>Among many other subjects Steele again wrote
numerous excellent papers on the stage. There
is the well-known account of Estcourt's death,
and there are admirable criticisms. Of Etherege's
popular play, <i>Sir Foppling Flutter</i>, he said
that it was "a perfect contradiction to good
manners, good sense, and common honesty";
and of Beaumont and Fletcher's <i>Scornful Lady</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>
that no beauty would atone for the meanness of
giving "a scandalous representation of what is
reputable among men, that is to say, what is
sacred." Elsewhere he remarked that "it is not
to be imagined what effect a well-regulated stage
would have upon men's manners," and that it is
in the people themselves "to raise this entertainment
to the greatest height."</p>

<p>Swift was now quite estranged from Addison
and Steele, though of course they were civil
when they met. In June, 1711, Steele appears to
have become acquainted with Pope, and Addison
wrote a flattering notice of the young
poet's <i>Art of Criticism</i> in the <i>Spectator</i>. Party
pamphleteering was now being carried to a
hitherto unprecedented extent, and Swift wrote
constantly himself, and supplied hints to others.
Marlborough was dismissed, and the object of
the Government was to bring the war to an end
by persuading the people to agree to a treaty
whose terms were less satisfactory than might
have been expected. At the same time some of
the party were secretly plotting for the restoration
of the Stuarts, and among these appears to
to have been Harley, now Earl of Oxford. Steele
wrote a pamphlet in praise of Marlborough, for
whom he always showed great admiration.</p>

<p>A son, Eugene, was born in March, 1712;
Steele was then living in Brownlow Street, Holborn.
In June he had a cottage on Haverstock
Hill, and there the members of the Kitcat Club<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span>
called for him on their way to the Upper Flask at
Hampstead, where they met in the summer. In
July he had taken a house in Bloomsbury
Square, and next month he felt relieved by the
renewal of his employments, and lived "in the
handsomest manner." But all the time actions
for debt were hanging over him, and he had
hastily to withdraw a scheme which was found
to be illegal, for "getting money" by means of a
"Multiplication Table," to be worked in connection
with the State Lottery.</p>

<p>The <i>Spectator</i> was brought to a close in December,
1712, and in the following month George
Berkeley, afterwards Bishop of Cloyne, but then
a young man just arrived in London, wrote that
Steele, who had been among the first to welcome
him, was ill with gout, but was, "as I am informed,
writing a play, since he gave over the
<i>Spectators</i>." Steele was very hospitable to the
young philosopher, and Berkeley remarks that
there appeared "in his natural temper something
very generous, and a great benevolence to mankind."
By the death of Mrs. Scurlock, Steele had
come into £500 a year, which made it more
justifiable for him to maintain his "handsome
and neatly furnished house," where the table,
servants, coach, &amp;c., were "very genteel."</p>

<p>A new periodical, <i>The Guardian</i>, was begun
on March 12, 1713, and was issued daily until
October. Steele wrote 82 of the 175 numbers,
and Addison, Berkeley and Pope were among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span>
the contributors. The periodical was written on
the same lines as the <i>Spectator</i>, and many of
the papers are excellent, but with the fortieth
number Steele was drawn into a political quarrel
with the <i>Examiner</i>, and the <i>Guardian</i> lost its value
as literature. Politics ran so high that the representatives
of each party applied to themselves
the noble sentiments in Addison's tragedy, <i>Cato</i>,
which was produced on April 14, and thus united
in applauding the piece. Steele had undertaken
to fill the house, and he wrote verses, afterwards
prefixed to the play, in which he alluded to the
fact that he had once inscribed Addison's name
to his own "light scenes"; they, however, would
soon die, and he therefore wished to "live, joined
to a work of thine."</p>

<p>Attacks in the <i>Examiner</i> led Steele to complain
of articles by "an estranged friend or an
exasperated mistress," <i>i.e.</i> Swift or Mrs. Manley.
Swift denied that he had at this time any hand
in the <i>Examiner</i>, and a bitter quarrel arose
between the two men. In June Steele resigned
his position as Commissioner of the Stamp
Office, and soon afterwards gave up his pension
as a servant of the late Prince. On August 25
he was elected M.P. for the borough of Stockbridge,
Hampshire. In the <i>Guardian</i> Steele had
insisted that as one of the conditions of the
peace the nation expected the demolition of
Dunkirk; and this was dwelt upon at greater
length in a pamphlet called <i>The Importance of</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span>
<i>Dunkirk considered.</i> A storm of controversial
literature followed these declarations, and, in
October the <i>Guardian</i> gave place to the <i>Englishman</i>,
which was devoted almost entirely to
politics. Addison said he was "in a thousand
troubles for poor Dick," and hoped that his zeal
for the public would not be ruinous to himself.
Swift wrote bitter attacks&mdash;<i>The Importance of the
Guardian considered</i> and <i>The First Ode of the
Second Book of Horace Paraphrased and addressed
to Richard St&mdash;le, Esq.</i>, in the latter of which
he suggested that when Steele had settled the
affairs of Europe he might turn to Drury Lane,
and produce the play with which he had long
threatened the town, and which had for plot&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"To make a pair of jolly fellows,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The son and father, join to tell us</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">How sons may safely disobey,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And fathers never should say nay;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By which wise conduct they grow friends</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">At last&mdash;and so the story ends."</span><br />
</p>

<p>In January, 1714, Steele brought out <i>The
Crisis</i>, a widely read pamphlet which set forth
the facts relating to the Hanoverian Succession,
and among the replies was Swift's <i>The Public
Spirit of the Whigs</i>. Steele defended himself in
the last number of the <i>Englishman</i>, and next
day Parliament met, and Steele spoke in support
of the motion that Sir Thomas Hanmer
should be Speaker. Complaint was soon made
that his writings were seditious, and, in spite
of the aid of Walpole, Stanhope, Addison, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span>
others, a motion for his expulsion was carried
by the Tory House, on March 18, after several
debates. In the meantime, the Whig House of
Lords had taken measures against the printer
and publisher of Swift's <i>Public Spirit of the
Whigs</i>, and had insisted upon a reward being
offered for the discovery of the author.</p>

<p>About this time Steele produced short-lived
periodicals called <i>The Lover</i> and <i>The Reader</i>,
and several political pamphlets. Although
£3,000 had been given him by some unknown
friends, he was involved in money difficulties,
and the house in Bloomsbury Square was given
up. But with the end of July came the serious
illness of Queen Anne, who died on August 1st.
The hopes of Bolingbroke and others were
thrown to the ground, and George I. was peacefully
proclaimed king. Bothmar at once acquainted
his royal master with Steele's services,
and soon after the king's arrival in England
Steele was made Deputy-Lieutenant for the
County of Middlesex, Surveyor of the Royal
Stables at Hampton Court, a Justice of the
Peace, and Supervisor of the Theatre Royal.
He found time to publish, in October, an important
pamphlet, <i>Mr. Steele's Apology for Himself
and his Writings</i>, and <i>The Ladies' Library</i>, a
compilation which he had revised, and which
contained an admirable Dedication to his wife,
concluding thus: "But I offend; and forget that
what I say to you is to appear in public. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span>
are so great a lover of home, that I know it will
be irksome to you to go into the world even in
an applause. I will end this without so much
as mentioning your little flock, or your own
amiable figure at the head of it. That I think
them preferable to all other children, I know is
the effect of passion and instinct. That I believe
you to be the best of wives, I know proceeds from
experience and reason."</p>


<h4>VIII.</h4>


<p>Until the death of the Queen, William Collier,
M.P., who held a licence to act, in conjunction
with Wilks, Cibber, Doggett, and Booth, had
received a pension from those actors of £700 a
year. At the accession of King George, as the
pension could not be wholly got rid of, the four
actors, as Colley Cibber tells us in his <i>Apology</i>,
"imagined the merit of a Whig might now have
as good a chance of getting into it, as that of a
Tory had for being continued in it: having no
obligations, therefore, to Collier, who had made
the last penny of them, they applied themselves"
to Steele, who had many pretensions to
favour at Court. "We knew, too, the obligations
the stage had to his writings; there being
scarce a comedian of merit, in our whole company,
whom his <i>Tatlers</i> had not made better by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span>
his public recommendation of them. And many
days had our House been particularly filled
by the influence and credit of his pen.... We
therefore begged him to use his interest for the
renewal of our licence, and that he would do us
the honour of getting our names to stand with
his, in the same Commission. This, we told
him, would put it still further into his power of
supporting the stage in that reputation to which
his Lucubrations had already so much contributed;
and that therefore we thought no man
had better pretences to partake of its success."
Steele was, of course, delighted at the offer.
"It surprised him into an acknowledgment,
that people, who are shy of obligations, are
cautious of confessing. His spirits took such a
lively turn upon it, that had we been all his own
sons, no unexpected act of filial duty could have
more endeared us to him." A new licence,
upon the first mention of it, was obtained by
Steele of the King, through the Duke of Marlborough,
"the hero of his heart," who was now
again Captain-General. According to a memorandum
of Steele's he received a message from
the King, "to know whether I was in earnest in
desiring the Playhouse or that others thought of
it for me. If I liked it I should have it as an
earnest of His future favour."</p>

<p>The prosperity of the early part of the season
of 1714-5 was checked by a renewal of the
licence to the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span>
and by the desertion to that house of seven or
eight actors. The other managers of Drury Lane
Theatre found it necessary to point out to Steele
that he stood in the same position as Collier,
and that his pension of £700 was liable to the
same conditions as Collier's, namely, that it was
to be paid only so long as there was but one
company allowed to act, and that if a second
company were set up, the pension was to be
changed from a fixed payment to an equal share
of the profits. To this Steele at once agreed.
"While we were offering to proceed," says
Cibber, "Sir Richard stopped us short by assuring
us, that as he came among us by our own
invitation, he should always think himself
obliged to come into any measures for our ease
and service; that to be a burden to our industry
would be more disagreeable to him than it could
be to us, and as he had always taken a delight
in his endeavours for our prosperity, he should
be still ready, on our own terms, to continue
them." Every one who knew Steele in his prosperity,
Cibber remarks, "knew that this was his
manner of dealing with his friends in business."
Steele, however, told Cibber and the others that
he was advised to get their licence during pleasure
enlarged into a more durable authority,
and with this object he proposed that he should
obtain a Patent for himself, for his life and three
years after, which he would then assign over to
them. To this the managers were only too glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[Pg li]</a></span>
to agree, for, among other benefits, it would free
them from too great a dependency upon the
Lord Chamberlain, or the officers under him,
who, not having "the hearts of noblemen," often
showed that insolence of office to which narrow
minds are liable. Steele accordingly applied
for a Patent, and his request was complied with
on January 19, 1715. A week earlier he had
received a gift of £500 from the King.</p>

<p>On the 20th of January, Steele left London for
Boroughbridge, a place for which he was to be
elected Member of Parliament on the 2nd of
the following month. The Patent was only
received on the 19th of January, and, therefore,
as Cibber says, "We were forced that very night
to draw up in a hurry (till our counsel might
more advisably perfect it) his assignment to us
of equal shares in the Patent, with farther conditions
of partnership.... This assignment
(which I had myself the hasty penning of) was
so worded, that it gave Sir Richard as equal a
title to our property as it had given us to his
authority in the Patent. But Sir Richard, notwithstanding,
when he returned to town, took no
advantage of the mistake." Cibber adds that
Steele's equity and honour proved as advantageous
to himself as to them, for instead of £700,
his income from the theatre, by his accepting a
share instead of the fixed pension, was about
£1,000 a year.</p>

<p>Steele was knighted, in company with two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span>
other Deputy-Lieutenants, in April, and in May
he celebrated the King's birthday by a grand
entertainment in the great room at York Buildings.
This room he called the "Censorium,"
and it was intended for select assemblies of two
hundred persons, "leaders in politeness, wit, and
learning." The undertaking appears to have
been successful, and it was carried on for some
time.</p>

<p>The <i>Englishman</i> was revived in July, with the
object of making good the accusations which
had been levelled long before against Oxford,
Bolingbroke, and other members of the late
Government. Steele appears to have asked for
£1,000 a year before undertaking this work,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
and from the fact that he continued the paper
after threatening to drop it when the third
number had been published, it would seem that
he was paid at least £500 by Walpole. Soon
afterwards he applied, but without success, for
the vacant Mastership of the Charterhouse. Of
Steele's various publications in 1715-6 it is
impossible to speak here; it will be enough to
notice that Addison's comedy, <i>The Drummer</i>,
was published by Steele on March 21, 1716,
with a preface in which he said that the play had
for some years been in the hands of the author,
who had been persuaded by him to allow of its
representation on the stage. In June he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg liii]</a></span>
appointed one of the thirteen Commissioners who
were to deal with the estates forfeited by noblemen
and gentlemen, chiefly Scottish, who had
taken up arms on the side of the Pretender during
the late rising. The salary was £1,000 a year.</p>

<p>Money difficulties made it necessary, in July,
1716, for Steele to mortgage his interest in the
theatre to an Edward Minshull, M.P., who had
on previous occasions lent him money. In
January, 1717, further money was raised upon
Steele's share of the scenery, clothes, and profits.
This led to much trouble, and ultimately to a
Chancery action, in 1722, which is described in
the Appendix. In that same year, Minshull,
who was a gambler, was found guilty of fraud,
but he succeeded in escaping to Holland.</p>

<p>Lady Steele went to Carmarthenshire in November,
1716, and remained there till the end
of the following year. When she left London
one of her children was sickening for the smallpox,
and, according to her husband, there was
not "an inch of candle, a pound of coal, or a bit
of meat in the house." The little girl recovered,
however, and money came in; and, during the
following weeks, Steele wrote some charming
letters about his "dear innocents," full of good
resolves for the future, which did not meet with
any very hearty response from his ailing wife.
In one letter he spoke of turning all his thoughts
to finish his comedy, but he also had great hopes
from a "Fish-pool scheme," the object of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg liv]</a></span>
was to bring fish alive to London. When his
"dear little peevish, beautiful, wise governess"
called him "good Dick," he said he was so
enraptured that he could forget his miserable
lameness&mdash;he was suffering from gout&mdash;and walk
down to Wales.</p>

<p>After many delays, Steele set out, in October,
to attend the meetings of the Forfeited Estates
Commission at Edinburgh, where he was very
well received. He was, however, soon back in
London, and, in June, 1718, obtained Letters
Patent for the Fish-pool, which was followed by
much litigation on the part of a man named
Sansome, who said he had rendered valuable aid
in developing the scheme. In the autumn,
Steele was again in Scotland, and in December
he lost his "dear and honoured wife." She was
buried in the south transept of Westminster
Abbey.</p>

<p>The Peerage Bill was introduced by the
Government in 1719, with a view of limiting the
power of creating new peers. The real object
was to prevent a growth of the influence either
of king or people, in both of which the aristocratic
Whigs saw danger to themselves. Steele
did not agree on this question with the party
leaders, and he was honest and bold enough to
oppose their bill in a paper called the <i>Plebeian</i>.
Addison replied in the <i>Old Whig</i>, and unfortunately
the controversy led to the estrangement
of the two friends. There was no opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</a></span>
for reconciliation, for Addison died shortly after
the appearance of these pamphlets. The Peerage
Bill was revived in November, but was thrown
out in December, immediately after the publication
of another pamphlet by Steele.</p>

<p>The Government at once took steps to punish
their candid friend. As early as 1717, the Duke of
Newcastle, who then became Lord Chamberlain,
had requested the managers of the theatre to
accept a licence in place of their patent. This
Steele declined to do, and the matter dropped;
but in the following year there was further
friction, owing to the claim of the managers that
they were exempt from the Duke's authority.
The Attorney-General was consulted on this
point, and upon the question whether Steele had
power to sell or alienate his interest in the
patent; but the result is not recorded. The first
act of revenge was an order, on December 19,
1719, forbidding Cibber&mdash;who had dedicated his
<i>Ximena</i> to Steele&mdash;to act or take part in the
management of the theatre. Steele remonstrated,
and commenced an interesting periodical called
the <i>Theatre</i>, in vindication of himself and his
fellow-managers. On January 23, 1720, the
licence was revoked, and the Lord Chamberlain
threatened to obtain a sign manual to silence
the theatre. Steele petitioned the King, but on
the 25th a warrant was issued forbidding any
acting at Drury Lane until further order. On
the 27th a licence, to be held during pleasure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[Pg lvi]</a></span>
was granted to Wilks, Cibber, and Booth; and
on March 4, in spite of every effort of Steele's
to obtain justice, the King's Company of Comedians
were sworn at the office of the Lord Chamberlain,
to whom they agreed to be subservient.
Next month, in the last number of the <i>Theatre</i>,
Steele alluded to the loss he had sustained in
not being able to produce his own pieces advantageously,
and stated that he would forthwith
publish a new comedy, called <i>Sir John Edgar</i>.
This agrees with letters from Dr. Rundle, who
wrote that it was said that a most excellent
comedy of Steele's was prevented being acted
at the Haymarket Theatre, lest its wit and sense
should spoil the relish for operas. This comedy,
however, never saw the light.</p>

<p>Throughout 1720 the country was occupied
with the fortunes of the South Sea Company and
other schemes, by which people hoped to make
rapid fortunes. Steele, both in and out of the
House, again opposed the action of ministers,
and his conduct was justified in the autumn,
when the bubble burst. Aislabie, the elder
Craggs, the Stanhopes, and Sunderland were all
compromised; and Walpole became First Lord
of the Treasury. Steele, as in the case of the
1715 Rebellion, advocated mercy towards the
directors of the company as individuals, though
he had fearlessly condemned their action while
they had the power of doing harm. On the 2nd
of May, 1721, through Walpole's influence, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[Pg lvii]</a></span>
Lord Chamberlain issued a warrant, ordering
the managers of the theatre to account to Steele
for his share of the profits, past and future. In
the autumn he was again in Scotland.</p>

<p>Articles quadrupartite were entered into on
September 19, between Steele, Wilks, Cibber,
and Booth, by which it was agreed that Steele's
executors should, for three years after his death,
receive one-fourth part of the profits of the
theatre, and should also have, at his death,
£1,200 for his share in the patent, clothes,
scenery, &amp;c. Further articles were also signed,
which had for their object the protection of the
actors in case Steele were again deprived by
order of the King or Lord Chamberlain of his
interest in the theatre. These agreements did
not prevent Steele having difficulty in getting
from the other managers his share of the profits,
though he had already given them £400 each, in
consideration, as they said, of a fourth part of
the scenery, &amp;c., which belonged to them. At
the close of the year Steele republished <i>The
Drummer</i>, which had not been included by
Tickell in the collected edition of Addison's
works, and prefixed to it a vindication of himself
from charges made by the editor. In March,
1722, he became Member of Parliament for
Wendover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[Pg lviii]</a></span></p>


<h4>IX.</h4>


<p>As early as 1720 Steele spoke in the <i>Theatre</i>
of "a friend of mine" who was lately preparing
a comedy according to the just laws of the stage,
and had introduced a scene in which the first
character bore unprovoked wrong, denied a duel,
and still appeared a man of honour and courage.
This was clearly an allusion to the play eventually
to be published as <i>The Conscious Lovers</i>.
And in a paragraph in Mist's <i>Weekly Journal</i>
for November 18, 1721, printed a year before
the play appeared, readers were informed that
"Sir Richard Steele proposes to represent a
character upon the stage this season that was
never seen there yet: His <i>Gentleman</i> has been
two years a dressing, and we wish he may make
a good appearance at last." In June, 1722,
Vanbrugh, in a letter to Tonson, lamented the
absence of new plays of any value. "Steele,
however," he said, "has one to come on at
winter, which they much commend." On September
22 the <i>British Journal</i> stated that a considerable
number of new plays were promised
at Drury Lane that season, and that Steele's
new comedy would be set up immediately after
Mrs. Centlivre's <i>The Artifice</i>. In October the
newspapers announced that Steele's play would
be called <i>The Unfashionable Lovers</i>, or as
others said, <i>The Fine Gentleman</i>. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[Pg lix]</a></span>
play was produced, on November 7th, the title
chosen was <i>The Conscious Lovers</i>.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oldfield, Mrs. Younger, Booth, Wilks,
and Cibber took the principal parts in what was,
in many respects, Steele's best play, and Benjamin
Victor says that the author, with whom
he sat at the first performance, was charmed
with all the actors except Griffin, who represented
Cimberton, a very ungrateful part. The
play ran for eighteen nights, which at that time
meant a great success, and there were eight
further performances during the season. It was
published in December,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> with a dedication to
the King, for which Steele appears to have
received five hundred guineas.</p>

<p>In the Preface the success of the play was
attributed to the excellent manner in which every
part was acted; for a play is meant to be seen,
not read. "The chief design of this was to be
an innocent performance, and the audience have
abundantly showed how ready they are to support
what is visibly intended that way; nor do I
make any difficulty to acknowledge that the
whole was writ for the sake of the scene of the
fourth act, wherein Mr Bevil evades the quarrel
with his friend; and hope it may have some
effect upon the Goths and Vandals that frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[Pg lx]</a></span>
the theatres, or a more polite audience may supply
their absence." The general idea of the play
was taken from Terence's <i>Andria</i>, but after the
first two acts Steele's indebtedness to Terence is
very slight. Cibber, however, rendered valuable
assistance. "Mr. Cibber's zeal for the work,"
wrote Steele, "his care and application in instructing
the actors, and altering the dispositions
of the scenes, when I was, through sickness,
unable to cultivate such things myself, has been
a very obliging favour and friendship to me."
Theophilus Cibber, who had a part in the
original cast, says that when Steele finished the
comedy, the parts of Tom and Phillis were not
in it, and that Colley Cibber, when he heard it
read, said he liked it upon the whole, but that it
was rather too grave for an English audience,
who think the end of a comedy is to make them
laugh. Steele thereupon agreed to the introduction
of some comic characters, and at his request
the play received many additions by Cibber. The
piece was, as Victor says, "the last blaze of Sir
Richard's glory"; and it is probable that Cibber
deserves all the thanks Steele gave him for preparing
for the stage the manuscript which had
for so long been in preparation, and which,
without assistance, might never have been completed.
It is difficult, however, to accept Theophilus
Cibber's account in its entirety, because
the germ of the delightful scene in which Tom,
the gentleman's gentleman, describes how he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[Pg lxi]</a></span>
fell in love with Phillis, is to be found in No. 87
of the <i>Guardian</i>, where Steele says he had in
mind a scene which he had recently observed
while passing a house. This is the form which
the story ultimately took:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Ah! Too well I remember when, and how, and on what
occasion I was first surprised. It was on the first of April, one
thousand seven hundred and fifteen, I came into Mr. Sealand's
service; I was then a hobbledehoy, and you a pretty little tight
girl, a favourite handmaid of the housekeeper. At that time we
neither of us knew what was in us: I remember I was ordered to
get out of the window, one pair of stairs, to rub the sashes clean;
the person employed on the inner side was your charming self, whom
I had never seen before.</p>

<p><i>Phillis.</i> I think I remember the silly accident: What made ye,
you oaf, ready to fall down into the street?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> You know not, I warrant you&mdash;You could not guess what
surprised me. You took no delight, when you immediately grew
wanton, in your conquest, and put your lips close, and breathed
upon the glass, and when my lips approached, a dirty cloth you
rubbed against my face, and hid your beauteous form; when I again
drew near, you spit, and rubbed, and smiled at my undoing.</p>

<p><i>Phillis.</i> What silly thoughts you men have!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> ... Oh, Phillis! Phillis! shorten my torment and declare
you pity me.</p>

<p><i>Phillis.</i> I believe it's very sufferable; the pain is not so exquisite
but that you may bear it a little longer.</p></blockquote>

<p>"If I were rich," said Phillis in another place,
"I could twire and loll as well as the best of them.
Oh, Tom! Tom! Is it not a pity that you should
be so great a coxcomb, and I so great a coquette,
and yet be such poor devils as we are?"</p>

<p>The names of some of the characters recall
earlier writings, for Lucinda and her father, Mr.
Sealand, Mr. Charles Myrtle, and Humphrey, the
servant, had all appeared in the <i>Theatre</i>, while
there was another Myrtle in the <i>Lover</i>. There are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[Pg lxii]</a></span>
too, passages which at once remind us of the
style of the earlier periodicals; thus Bevil, after
escorting a music-master to the door, says to
Indiana, "You smile, madam, to see me so complaisant
to one whom I pay for his visit: Now,
I own, I think it is not enough barely to pay
those whose talents are superior to our own (I
mean such talents as would become our condition,
if we had them). Methinks we ought to do
something more than barely gratify them for
what they do at our command, only because
their fortune is below us"; to which Indiana
replies, "You said, I smile; I assure you it was
a smile of approbation; for, indeed, I cannot but
think it the distinguishing part of a gentleman
to make his superiority of fortune as easy to his
inferiors as he can." Or, to take another passage
in the conversation of these same "conscious
lovers," Bevil remarks, "If pleasure be
worth purchasing, how great a pleasure is it to
him, who has a true taste of life, to ease an
aching heart, to see the human countenance
lighted up with smiles of joy on receipt of a bit
of ore which is superfluous and otherwise useless
in a man's own pocket." He even remembers
to praise Addison: "The moral writers practise
virtue after death: This charming Vision of
Mirza! Such an author consulted in a morning
sets the spirit for the vicissitudes of the day
better than the glass does a man's person." And
when Sir John Bevil observes that, "What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[Pg lxiii]</a></span>
might injure a citizen's credit may be no strain
to a gentleman's honour," Mr. Sealand says,
"Sir John, the honour of a gentleman is liable
to be tainted by as small a matter as the credit
of a trader." Much the same lesson is taught,
less sententiously, when Phillis exclaims, "Oh,
Tom! Tom! thou art as false and as base as the
best gentleman of them all."</p>

<p>Parson Adams said that he thought <i>The Conscious
Lovers</i> the only play fit for a Christian to
see; "indeed," he added, "it contains some
things almost solemn enough for a sermon." In
this kindly satire Fielding indicated the weakness
of the play. The chief interest of the piece is
sentimental, and the hero is not always free from
priggishness. Yet the duelling scene, for which,
as Steele says, the whole was written, has much
dramatic interest, and the protest against false
ideas of honour&mdash;"decisions a tyrant custom has
introduced, to the breach of all laws both divine
and human"&mdash;was at that time courageous, and
much needed. If some of the things expressed
in this play are more suited for a paper in the
<i>Spectator</i>, there is nothing in true comedy which
makes it incongruous to convey, in a manner
suited to that form of art, a serious lesson of life.
If, again, as some say, there is more pathos than
is allowable in the scene in which Sealand
recovers his long-lost daughter and sister, the
end is that of true comedy; the "pedantic coxcomb"
Cimberton no longer wants Sealand's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[Pg lxiv]</a></span>
daughter when he finds that, by the discovery of
Indiana, Lucinda's fortune will be halved; Bevil
is able, in marrying Indiana, the lady he loves,
to comply with his father's wish that he should
be united to Sealand's daughter; and Bevil's
friend, Myrtle, the true lover whose affection is
not lessened by change in the lady's dowry, is
rewarded with the hand of Lucinda. The friends,
formerly supposed by one of them to be rivals,
thus become brothers.</p>

<p>Steele alluded to current criticism when he
said, in his Preface, that the incident of the
threatened duel and the case of the father and
daughter were thought by some to be no subjects
of comedy; "but I cannot," he continued,
"be of their mind, for anything that has its
foundation in happiness and success must be
allowed to be the object of comedy." His object,
as Welsted said in the Prologue, was to</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"please by wit that scorns the aid of vice;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The praise he seeks, from worthier motives springs,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Such praise, as praise to those that give, it brings."</span><br />
</p>

<p>It was for the audience</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"To chasten wit, and moralise the stage."</span><br />
</p>

<p>If success is to be measured by the amount of
discussion caused by a work, <i>The Conscious Lovers</i>
was, indeed, fortunate. Dennis began the attack
in a pamphlet before the play was publicly acted,
and afterwards returned to the charge. Much of
what he said was personal abuse, but some of
his remarks are interesting, and show what were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[Pg lxv]</a></span>
then held to be the weak points in the piece. He
complained that Bevil was given the qualities of
an old man, and maintained that the characters
were not just images of their contemporaries,
that patterns for imitation were set up instead of
follies and vices being made ridiculous, and that
the subject of the comedy was not by its constitution
comical. Bevil's filial piety, he said, was
carried too far, and his behaviour to Indiana was
still more unaccountable, for though he had in
one sense concealed his passion, there was no
retreat with honour for him, because by his generosity
and constant visits he had raised a passion
for him in Indiana, and had compromised her.
The catastrophe, he confessed, was very moving,
but it might have been more surprising, if handled
differently. The action in Terence's play was
natural, as, for example, the conduct of Glycerium
at the funeral of Chrysis; but the scene
at the masquerade between Bevil and Indiana
was an absurd imitation, for Indiana did not
know that her affection was returned. As for
Bevil, "this man of conscience and of religion is
as arrant an hypocrite as a certain author," and
was constantly dissimulating. Dennis concluded
by saying that the sentiments were often frivolous,
false, and absurd; the dialogue awkward,
clumsy, and spiritless; the diction affected, barbarous,
and too often Hibernian.</p>

<p>There were other pamphlets for and against
the play, and the newspapers contained many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[Pg lxvi]</a></span>
articles on the subject. One writer remarked
that a great part of Squire Cimberton's conversation,
"some of which has since been omitted,"
could not be reconciled with rules often laid
down by Steele. "He [Steele] must always be
agreeable, till he ceases to be at all; and yet
it has been always fashionable to use him
ill: Blockheads of quality, who are scarce capable
of reading his works, have affected a sort of
ill-bred merit in despising 'em; and they who
have no taste for his writings, have pretended to
a displeasure at his conduct."</p>


<h4>X.</h4>


<p>The remaining years of Steele's life need not
detain us long. In 1723 he wrote to his eldest
daughter, Betty, "I have taken a great deal of
pains to serve the world, and hope God will allow
me some time to serve my own family. My good
girl, employ yourself always in some good work,
that you may be as good a woman as your
mother." A few days later Vanbrugh wrote,
"Happening to meet with Sir Richard Steele
t'other day at Mr. Walpole's in town, he seemed
to me to be (at least) in the declining way I had
heard he was." The complications arising from
the mortgage of Steele's interest in the theatre
still troubled him, and from the 18th of June the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[Pg lxvii]</a></span>
other managers each took, for his own use,
£1 13s. 4d. for every day upon which a play was
acted, an arrangement from which Steele was
excluded.</p>

<p>The success of <i>The Conscious Lovers</i> encouraged
Steele to endeavour to finish another
play; and the newspapers reported that it would
be acted that winter. This was <i>The School of
Action</i>, which has for its scene a theatre, mistaken
by a lady's guardian for an inn; but the piece
was left in a very incomplete condition. There
is also a fragment of another play, <i>The Gentleman</i>;
it was a dramatised version of a paper in
the <i>Spectator</i> upon high life below stairs. In
September illness forced Steele to go to Bath,
and a few weeks later his only surviving son,
Eugene, died. "Lord, grant me patience; pray
write to me constantly," the father wrote to Betty:
"Why don't you mention Molly? Is she dead,
too?" In the spring of 1724 he was again in
London, and in April a proposal for the payment
of his debts was drawn up, from which it appears
that, as he lived for more than five years afterwards,
his liabilities were probably all met before
his death. There was again reference to "a
new play, which Sir Richard may produce next
winter." In June an indenture quadrupartite
was made between Steele, of the first part; Wilks,
Cibber, and Booth, of the second part; a number
of creditors, of the third part; and the Rev. David
Scurlock, of the fourth part, to provide for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">[Pg lxviii]</a></span>
payment of debts out of Steele's share of the
profits of the theatre. For this purpose Mr.
Scurlock&mdash;Lady Steele's cousin&mdash;was appointed
trustee.</p>

<p>The autumn of 1724 was spent at Carmarthen.
In February, 1725, Steele was at Hereford, where
he received £100 from the King's bounty; and
in July he was again at Carmarthen. He retired
to the country from "a principle of doing justice
to his creditors," and not, as Swift said after his
death, because of the "perils of a hundred gaols."
In December, 1724, the other managers urged
him to return to town at once; the audiences
decreased daily, and it was impossible to contend
against other forms of entertainment; the profits
had fallen by more than a half. Nothing came
of this application, and in September, 1725, protracted
law proceedings were instituted in the
Court of Chancery, by Steele and Scurlock,
against Wilks, Cibber, Booth, Castleman, and
Woolley. An abstract of the pleadings will be
found in the Appendix. The Court gave judgment
in February, 1728, confirming the allowance
of £1 13s. 4d. a day to each of the three
managers; but the case was not brought to a close
until July, when, as Cibber says, "Sir Richard
not being advised to appeal to the Lord Chancellor,
both parties paid their own costs, and
thought it their mutual interest to let this be the
last of their law suits."</p>

<p>During the remaining three years of his life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">[Pg lxix]</a></span>
Steele lived chiefly at Tygwyn, a farm-house
overlooking the Towy, and within sight of Carmarthen.
There he had a stroke of paralysis,
which was accompanied by a partial loss of
speech, but he kept his sweetness of temper and
kindliness towards others to the last. There is a
pleasant anecdote, told by Victor, and fully confirmed
elsewhere, that he "would often be carried
out on a summer's evening, where the country
lads and lasses were assembled at their rural
sports, and, with his pencil, give an order on his
agent, the mercer, for a new gown to the best
dancer." By his will, made in 1727, and witnessed
by John Dyer, the poet, he left the residue
of his small property, after certain legacies, to
his "dear and well-beloved daughters, Elizabeth
and Mary." Elizabeth, who had many admirers,
afterwards married Lord Trevor; Mary died
shortly after her father. Before his death Steele
was moved to a house in King Street, Carmarthen,
where he passed away on September 1,
1729. On the 4th he was privately buried in the
vault of the Scurlocks, in St. Peter's Church.
This vault was accidentally opened in 1876, and
Steele's remains exposed to view; but they were
carefully re-interred, and the skull enclosed in
a small lead coffin.</p>

<p>Steele's faults are apparent, and they have not
been allowed to be forgotten by writers of his
own day or of later times. That he was thriftless
is manifest, but his income, though it came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxx" id="Page_lxx">[Pg lxx]</a></span>
from various sources, was uncertain and irregular,
and he had passed the prime of life before he had
anything like handsome means. Many of his
debts, too, are to be accounted for by the generosity
and open-handedness which are a characteristic
of the nation in which he was born.
That he sometimes drank more than was wise is
equally well known, but that fault does not strike
us so much when we remember that hard drinking
was then the common practice, and that
many could consume, with impunity, an amount
which would undoubtedly have upset Steele
entirely.</p>

<p>Against these defects, and a certain general
weakness of character to which they were due,
we have to set his unselfish patriotism, the high
aims of his writings, which had a most beneficial
effect upon his own and future generations, his
affection for wife and children, and his loyalty to
his friends. Whatever there is to forgive is more
than made up for by these qualities, which have
made him, to this day, one of the best-loved
characters of his time.</p>

<p>Steele's comedies were often reprinted in
separate form during the century following their
production, and there were about a dozen editions
in which these separate plays were collected
together, with a general title-page. The
last of these bears the date 1761. In 1809
Nichols published the fragments of two unfinished
comedies in his edition of Steele's Correspondence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi">[Pg lxxi]</a></span>
In the present volume all Steele's
dramatic works have for the first time been
gathered together, and an attempt has been made
to provide such annotation as seemed necessary.
Changes of scene, sometimes not noticed in the
old copies, have been indicated, and modern conventions
respecting spelling and the like have
been adopted, while punctuation, which was very
erratic in the early issues, has, where necessary,
been modified. The text has been collated with
the first and later editions of each play.</p>

<p><i>The Funeral: or, Grief à-la-Mode</i>, a
Comedy, was written in the summer of
1701, and given to Christopher Rich,
of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in
October. Soon afterwards it was acted,
and it was published by Jacob Tonson
between December 18 and 20, with
the date 1702 on the title-page. The music to the songs,
by William Croft, appeared between December 16 and
18. The original cast included Cibber (Lord Hardy),
Wilks (Campley), Mills (Trusty), Pinkethman (Trim),
Norris (Mrs. Fardingale), and Bullock (Kate Matchlock);
with Mrs. Verbruggen (Lady Brumpton), Mrs.
Rogers (Lady Harriot), and Mrs. Oldfield (Lady Sharlot).
The play was revived occasionally in most of
the years between 1703 and 1734, and from time to
time during the following half-century, the last date,
apparently, being April 17, 1799. The plot is entirely
original.</p>

<h4><i>To the Right Honourable the</i></h4>

<h3>COUNTESS OF ALBEMARLE.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>Among the many novelties with which
your ladyship, a stranger in our nation,
is daily entertained, you have not yet
been made acquainted with the poetical
English liberty, the right of dedication;
which entitles us to a privilege
of celebrating whatever for its native
excellence is the just object of praise, and is an ancient
charter, by which the Muses have always a free access to
the habitation of the Graces.</p>

<p>Hence it is that this Comedy waits on your Ladyship,
and presumes to welcome you amongst us; though indeed,
madam, we are surprised to see you bring with
you, what we thought was of our own growth only, an
agreeable beauty; nay, we must assure you, that we cannot
give up so dear an article of our glory, but assert it
by our right in you: for if 'tis a maxim founded on the
noblest human law, that of hospitality, that every soil is
a brave man's country, England has a very just pretence
of claiming as a native a daughter of Mr. Scravenmore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>But your Ladyship is not only endeared to us by the
great services of your father, but also by the kind offices
of your husband, whose frank carriage falls in with our
genius, which is free, open, and unreserved. In this the
generosity of your tempers makes you both excel in so
peculiar a manner, that your good actions are their own
reward; nor can they be returned with ingratitude, for
none can forget the benefits you confer so soon as you
do yourselves.</p>

<p>But ye have a more indisputable title to a dramatic
performance than all these advantages; for you are yourselves,
in a degenerate low age, the noblest characters
which that fine passion that supports the stage has inspired;
and as you have practised as generous a fidelity
as the fancies of poets have ever drawn in their expecting
lovers, so may you enjoy as high a prosperity as ever they
have bestowed on their rewarded. This you may possess
in an happy security, for your fortunes cannot move so
much envy as your persons love.</p>

<p>I am, Madam,</p>

<p>Your Ladyship's most devoted</p>

<p>Humble Servant,</p>

<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<p>The rehearsal of this Comedy was
honoured with the presence of the
Duke of Devonshire,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> who is as distinguished
by his fine understanding
as high quality. The innocence of it
moved him to the humanity of expressing
himself in its favour. 'Tis
his manner to be pleased where he is not offended; a
condescension which delicate spirits are obliged to for
their own ease, for they would have but a very ill time of
it if they suffered themselves to be diverted with nothing
but what could bear their judgment.</p>

<p>That elegant and illustrious person will, I hope, pardon
my gratitude to the town, which obliges me to report so
substantial a reason for their approbation of this play, as
that he permitted it. But I know not in what words to
thank my fellow-soldiers for their warmth and zeal in my
behalf, nor to what to attribute their undeserved favour,
except it be that 'tis habitual to 'em to run to the
succour of those they see in danger.</p>

<p>The subject of the drama 'tis hoped will be acceptable
to all lovers of mankind, since ridicule is partly levelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
at a set of people who live in impatient hopes to see us
out of the world, a flock of ravens that attend this
numerous city for their carcases; but, indeed, 'tis not in
the power of any pen to speak 'em better than they do
themselves. As, for example, on a door I just now
passed by, a great artist thus informs us of his cures upon
the dead:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>W. W., known and approved for his art of embalming, having
preserved the corpse of a gentlewoman, sweet and entire, thirteen
years, without embowelling, and has reduced the bodies of several
persons of quality to sweetness, in Flanders and Ireland, after nine
months' putrefaction in the ground, and they were known by their
friends in England. No man performeth the like.</p></blockquote>

<p>He must needs be strangely in love with this life who
is not touched with this kind invitation to be pickled;
and the noble operator must be allowed a very useful
person for bringing old friends together; nor would it be
unworthy his labour to give us an account at large of the
sweet conversation that arose upon meeting such an
entire friend as he mentions.</p>

<p>But to be serious: Is there anything, but its being
downright fact, could make a rational creature believe
'twere possible to arrive at this fantastic posthumous
folly? Not at the same time but that it were buffoonery
rather than satire to explode all funeral honours; but
then it is certainly necessary to make 'em such that the
mourners should be in earnest, and the lamented worthy
of our sorrow. But this purpose is so far from being
served, that it is utterly destroyed by the manner of proceeding
among us, where the obsequies, which are due
only to the best and highest of human race (to admonish
their short survivors that neither wit, nor valour, nor
wisdom, nor glory can suspend our fate), are prostituted
and bestowed upon such as have nothing in common
with men but their mortality.</p>

<p>But the dead man is not to pass off so easily, for his
last thoughts are also to suffer dissection, and it seems
there is an art to be earned to speak our own sense in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
other men's words, and a man in a gown that never saw his
face shall tell you immediately the design of the deceased,
better than all his old acquaintance; which is so perfect
an hocus-pocus that, without you can repeat such and
such words, you cannot convey what is in your hands
into another's; but far be it from any man's thought to
say there are not men of strict integrity of the long robe,
though it is not everybody's good fortune to meet
with 'em.</p>

<p>However, the daily legal villanies we see committed
will also be esteemed things proper to be prosecuted by
satire, nor could our ensuing Legislative do their country
a more seasonable office than to look into the distresses
of an unhappy people, who groan perhaps in as much
misery under entangled as they could do under broken
laws; nor could there be a reward high enough assigned
for a great genius, if such may be found, who has capacity
sufficient to glance through the false colours that are
put upon us, and propose to the English world a method
of making justice flow in an uninterrupted stream; there
is so clear a mind in being, whom we will name in words
that of all men breathing can be only said of him; 'tis
he<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> that is excellent&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Seu linguam causis acuit, seu civica jura</span><br />

</p>

<p>Other enemies that may arise against this poor play
are indeed less terrible, but much more powerful than
these, and they are the ladies; but if there is anything
that argues a soured man, who lashes all for Lady
Brumpton, we may hope there will be seen also a devoted
heart that esteems all for Lady Sharlot.</p>

<h3><i>THE FUNERAL: OR, GRIEF À-LA-MODE.</i></h3>


<h3>ACT THE FIRST.</h3>


<h4>SCENE&mdash;<i>Covent Garden.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Cabinet, Sable</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Campley</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cab.</i> I burst into laughter, I can't bear to
see writ over an undertaker's door,
"Dresses for the Dead, and Necessaries
for Funerals!" Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Sab.</i> Well, gentlemen, 'tis very
well; I know you are of the laughers,
the wits that take the liberty to
deride all things that are magnificent and solemn.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Nay, but after all, I can't but admire Sable's
nice discerning on the superfluous cares of mankind, that
could lead them to the thought of raising an estate by
providing horses, equipage, and furniture, for those that
no longer need 'em.</p>

<p><i>Cab.</i> But is it not strangely contradictory, that men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
can come to so open, so apparent an hypocrisy, as in the
face of all the world, to hire professed mourners to grieve,
lament, and follow in their stead their nearest relations,
and suborn others to do by art what they themselves
should be prompted to by nature?</p>

<p><i>Sab.</i> That's reasonably enough said, but they regard
themselves only in all they act for the deceased, and the
poor dead are delivered to my custody, to be embalmed,
slashed, cut, and dragged about, not to do them honour,
but to satisfy the vanity or interest of their survivors.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> This fellow's every way an undertaker! How
well and luckily he talks! His prating so aptly has
methinks something more ridiculous in it than if he were
absurd. [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Cabinet</span>.</p>

<p><i>Cab.</i> But, as Mr. Campley says, how could you dream
of making a fortune from so chimerical a foundation as
the provision of things wholly needless and insignificant?</p>

<p><i>Sab.</i> Alas, gentlemen, the value of all things under the
sun is merely fantastic. We run, we strive, and purchase
things with our blood and money, quite foreign to our
intrinsic real happiness, and which have a being in imagination
only, as you may see by the pudder<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> that is made
about precedence, titles, court favour, maidenheads, and
china-ware.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Ay, Mr. Sable, but all those are objects that promote
our joy, are bright to the eye, or stamp upon our
minds pleasure and self-satisfaction.</p>

<p><i>Sab.</i> You are extremely mistaken, sir; for one would
wonder to consider that after all our outcries against self-interested
men, there are few, very few, in the whole world
that live to themselves, but sacrifice their bosom-bliss to
enjoy a vain show, and appearance of prosperity in the
eyes of others; and there is often nothing more inwardly
distressed than a young bride in her glittering retinue, or
deeply joyful than a young widow in her weeds and black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
train; of both which, the lady of this house may be an
instance, for she has been the one, and is, I'll be sworn,
the other.</p>

<p><i>Cab.</i> You talk, Mr. Sable, most learnedly!</p>

<p><i>Sab.</i> I have the deepest learning, sir, experience.
Remember your widow cousin that married last month.</p>

<p><i>Cab.</i> Ay! But how could you imagine she was in all
that grief an hypocrite? Could all those shrieks, those
swoonings, that rising, falling bosom be constrained?
You're uncharitable, Sable, to believe it&mdash;&mdash;What
colour, what reason had you for it?</p>

<p><i>Sab.</i> First, sir, her carriage in her concerns with me,
for I never yet could meet with a sorrowful relict, but
was herself enough to make an hard bargain with me.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>&mdash;Yet
I must confess they have frequent interruptions of
grief and sorrow when they read my bill&mdash;but as for her,
nothing, she resolved, that looked bright or joyous should
after her love's death approach her. All her servants
that were not coal black must turn out; a fair complexion
made her eyes and heart ache, she'd none but downright
jet, and to exceed all example she hired my mourning
furniture by the year, and in case of my mortality tied
my son to the same article; so in six weeks' time ran
away with a young fellow&mdash;&mdash;Prithee push on briskly,
Mr. Cabinet, now is your time to have this widow, for
Tattleaid tells me she always said she'd never marry&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cab.</i> As you say, that's generally the most hopeful sign.</p>

<p><i>Sab.</i> I tell you, sir, 'tis an infallible one; you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
those professions are only to introduce discourse of matrimony
and young fellows.</p>

<p><i>Cab.</i> But I swear I could not have confidence even
after all our long acquaintance, and the mutual love
which his lordship (who indeed has now been so kind
as to leave us) has so long interrupted, to mention a
thing of such a nature so unseasonably&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sab.</i> Unseasonably! Why, I tell you 'tis the only
season (granting her sorrow unfeigned): When would you
speak of passion, but in the midst of passions? There's
a what d'ye call, a crisis<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>&mdash;the lucky minute that's so
talked of, is a moment between joy and grief, which you
must take hold of and push your fortune&mdash;&mdash;But get
you in, and you'll best read your fate in the reception
Mrs. Tattleaid gives you. All she says, and all she does,
nay, her very love and hatred are mere repetition of her
ladyship's passions. I'll say that for her, she's a true
lady's woman, and is herself as much a second-hand
thing as her clothes. But I must beg your pardon, gentlemen,
my people are come I see&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Exeunt</i>
<span class="smcap">Cab.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Camp.</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sable's</span> <i>Men.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Where in the name of goodness have you all been?
Have you brought the sawdust and tar for embalming?
Have you the hangings and the sixpenny nails, and my
lord's coat-of-arms?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Ser.</i> Yes, sir, and had come sooner, but I went to the
Herald's for a coat for Alderman Gathergrease that died
last night&mdash;&mdash;He has promised to invent one against
to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Sab.</i> Ah! Pox take some of our cits, the first thing
after their death is to take care of their birth&mdash;&mdash;Pox,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
let him bear a pair of stockings, he's the first of his family
that ever wore one. Well, come you that are to be
mourners in this house, put on your sad looks, and walk
by me that I may sort you. Ha, you! a little more upon
the dismal [<i>forming their countenances</i>]; this fellow has a
good mortal look&mdash;place him near the corpse. That
wainscot face must be o' top of the stairs; that fellow's
almost in a fright (that looks as if he were full of some
strange misery) at the entrance of the hall&mdash;so&mdash;but
I'll fix you all myself&mdash;&mdash;Let's have no laughing now on
any provocation [<i>makes faces</i>]. Look yonder, that hale,
well-looking puppy! You ungrateful scoundrel, did not
I pity you, take you out of a great man's service, and
show you the pleasure of receiving wages? Did not I
give you ten, then fifteen, now twenty shillings a week, to
be sorrowful? and the more I give you, I think, the
gladder you are.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter a</i> <span class="smcap">Boy</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Sir, the gravedigger of St. Timothy's-in-the-Fields
would speak with you.</p>

<p><i>Sab.</i> Let him come in.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Gravedigger</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Grav.</i> I carried home to your house the shroud the
gentleman was buried in last night. I could not get his ring
off very easily, therefore I brought the finger and all; and
sir, the sexton gives his service to you, and desires to
know whether you'd have any bodies removed or not.
If not, he'll let 'em lie in their graves a week longer.</p>

<p><i>Sab.</i> Give him my service, I can't tell readily; but our
friend, tell him, Dr. Passeport, with the powder, has promised
me six or seven funerals this week. I'll send to
our country-farm at Kensington Gravel Pits, and our City-house
in Warwick Lane for news; you shall know time
enough. Harkee, be sure there's care taken to give my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Lady Languishe's woman a fee to keep out that young
fellow came last from Oxford; he'll ruin us all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Goody Trash</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>I wonder, Goody Trash, you could not be more punctual,
when I told you I wanted you, and your two
daughters, to be three virgins to-night to stand in white
about my Lady Katherine Grissel's body; and you know
you were privately to bring her home from the man-midwife's,
where she died in childbirth, to be buried like
a maid; but there is nothing minded. Well, I have put
off that till to-morrow; go and get your bag of brick-dust
and your whiting. Go and sell to the cook-maids; know
who has surfeited about town. Bring me no bad news,
none of your recoveries again. And you, Mr. Blockhead,
I warrant you have not called at Mr. Pestle's, the apothecary:
Will that fellow never pay me? I stand bound
for all the poison in that starving murderer's shop. He
serves me just as Dr. Quibus did, who promised to write
a treatise against water-gruel, a damned healthy slop, that
has done me more injury than all the faculty. Look you
now, you are all upon the sneer; let me have none but
downright stupid countenances&mdash;&mdash;I've a good mind to
turn you all off, and take people out of the play-house;
but, hang 'em, they are as ignorant of their parts as you
are of yours, they never act but when they speak; when
the chief indication of the mind is in the gesture, or
indeed in case of sorrow in no gesture, except you were
to act a widow, or so&mdash;&mdash;But yours, you dolts, is all
in dumb show; dumb show? I mean expressive eloquent
show: As who can see such an horrid ugly phiz as that
fellow's and not be shocked, offended, and killed of all
joy while he beholds it? But we must not loiter&mdash;&mdash;Ye
stupid rogues, whom I have picked out of all the rubbish
of mankind, and fed for your eminent worthlessness,
attend, and know that I speak you this moment stiff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and immutable to all sense of noise, mirth, or laughter
[<i>Makes mouths at them as they pass by him to bring them
to a constant countenance</i>]. So, they are pretty well&mdash;pretty
well&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Trusty</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Brumpton</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tru.</i> 'Twas fondness, sir, and tender duty to you, who
have been so worthy and so just a master to me, made
me stay near you; they left me so, and there I found you
wake from your lethargic slumber; on which I will assume
an authority to beseech you, sir, to make just use of your
revived life, in seeing who are your true friends, and
knowing her who has so wrought upon your noble nature
as to make it act against itself in disinheriting your brave
son.</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> Sure 'tis impossible she should be such a
creature as you tell me&mdash;&mdash;My mind reflects upon ten
thousand endearments that plead unanswerably for her.
Her chaste reluctant love, her easy observance of all my
wayward humours, to which she would accommodate
herself with so much ease, I could scarce observe it was a
virtue in her; she hid her very patience.</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> It was all art, sir, or indifference to you, for what
I say is downright matter of fact.</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> Why didst thou ever tell me it? or why not
in my lifetime, for I must call it so, nor can I date a
minute mine, after her being false; all past that moment
is death and darkness: Why didst thou not tell me
then, I say?</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> Because you were too much in love with her to
be informed; nor did I ever know a man that touched
on conjugal affairs could ever reconcile the jarring
humours but in a common hatred of the intermeddler.
But on this most extraordinary occasion, which seems
pointed out by Heaven itself to disengage you from your
cruelty and banishment of an innocent child, I must, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
will conjure you to be concealed, and but contain yourself,
in hearing one discourse with that cursed instrument
of all her secrets, that Tattleaid, and you'll see what I
tell you; you'll call me then your guardian and good
genius.</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> Well, you shall govern me, but would I had
died in earnest ere I'd known it; my head swims, as it
did when I fell into my fit, at the thoughts of it&mdash;&mdash;How
dizzy a place is this world you live in! All human
life's a mere vertigo!</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> Ay, ay, my lord, fine reflections&mdash;fine reflections,&mdash;but
that does no business. Thus, sir, we'll stand concealed,
and hear, I doubt not, a much sincerer dialogue
than usual between vicious persons; for a late accident
has given a little jealousy, which makes 'em over-act
their love and confidence in each other. [<i>They retire.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Widow</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Tattleaid</span> <i>meeting, and running to
each other.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Wid.</i> O, Tattleaid! His and our hour is come!</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> I always said, by his churchyard cough, you'd
bury him, but still you were impatient&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Nay, thou hast ever been my comfort, my confidant,
my friend, and my servant; and now I'll reward thy
pains; for though I scorn the whole sex of fellows, I'll
give 'em hopes for thy sake; every smile, every frown,
every gesture, humour, caprice and whimsey of mine shall
be gold to thee, girl; thou shalt feel all the sweet and
wealth of being a fine rich widow's woman. Oh! how
my head runs my first year out, and jumps to all the joys
of widowhood! If thirteen months hence a friend should
haul one to a play one has a mind to see, what pleasure
'twill be when my Lady Brumpton's footman's called (who
kept a place for that very purpose) to make a sudden
insurrection of fine wigs in the pit and side-boxes. Then,
with a pretty sorrow in one's face and a willing blush for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
being stared at, one ventures to look round and bow to one
of one's own quality. Thus [<i>very directly</i>] to a smug pretending
fellow of no fortune: Thus [<i>as scarce seeing him</i>]
to one that writes lampoons: Thus [<i>fearfully</i>] to one
one really loves: Thus [<i>looking down</i>] to one's woman-acquaintance;
from box to box thus [<i>with looks differently
familiar</i>]: And when one has done one's part, observe
the actors do their's, but with my mind fixed not on those
I look at, but those that look at me&mdash;&mdash;Then the
serenades! The lovers!</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> O, madam, you make my heart bound within
me. I'll warrant you, madam, I'll manage 'em all; and
indeed, madam, the men are really very silly creatures,
'tis no such hard matter&mdash;&mdash;They rulers! They governors!
I warrant you indeed!</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Ay, Tattleaid, they imagine themselves mighty
things, but government founded on force only is a brutal
power. We rule them by their affections, which blinds
them into belief that they rule us, or at least are in the
government with us&mdash;&mdash;But in this nation our power
is absolute. Thus, thus, we sway&mdash;[<i>playing her fan</i>].
A fan is both the standard and the flag of England. I
laugh to see the men go on our errands; strut in great
offices; live in cares, hazards, and scandals; to come home
and be fools to us in brags of their dispatches, negotiations,
and their wisdom&mdash;as my good, dear deceased used
to entertain me; which I, to relieve myself from, would
lisp some silly request, pat him on the face&mdash;&mdash;He
shakes his head at my pretty folly, calls me simpleton,
gives me a jewel, then goes to bed so wise, so satisfied,
and so deceived!</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> But I protest, madam, I've always wondered how
you could accomplish my young lord's being disinherited.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Why, Tatty, you must know my late lord&mdash;how
prettily that sounds, my late lord! But I say, my late
Lord Frible was generosity&mdash;I pressed him there, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
whenever you, by my order, had told him stories to my
son-in-law's disadvantage, in his rage and resentment I
(whose interest lay otherwise) always fell on my knees to
implore his pardon, and with tears, sighs, and importunities
for him, prevailed against him; besides this, you
know, I had, when I pleased, fits&mdash;fits are a mighty help
in the government of a good-natured man; but in an ill-natured
fellow have a care of 'em&mdash;he'll hate you for
natural infirmities, will remember your face in its distortion,
and not value your return of beauty.</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> O rare madam! your ladyship's a great headpiece;
but now, dear madam, is the hard task, if I
may take the liberty to say it&mdash;to enjoy all freedoms,
and seem to abstain, to manage the number of pretenders,
and keep the disobliged from prating&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Never fear, Tattleaid; while you have riches,
if you affront one to abuse, you can give hopes to
another to defend you. These maxims I have been
laying up all my husband's life-time, for we must provide
against calamities.</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> But now, madam, a fine young gentleman with a
red coat, that dances&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> You may be sure the happy man (if it
be in fate that there is an happy man to make me an
unhappy woman) shall not be an old one again. Age
and youth married, is the cruelty in Dryden's <i>Virgil</i>,
where Mezentius ties the dead and living together.
I'm sure I was tied to a dead man many a long
day before I durst bury him&mdash;&mdash;But the day is now my
own. Yet now I think on't, Tattleaid, be sure to
keep an obstinate shyness to all our old acquaintance.
Let 'em talk of favours if they please; if we grant 'em,
still they'll grow tyrants to us; if we discard 'em, the
chaste and innocent will not believe we could have
confidence to do it, were it so; and the wise, if they
believe it, will applaud our prudence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> Ay, madam&mdash;I believe, madam&mdash;I speak,
madam, but my humble sense&mdash;Mr. Cabinet would
marry you.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Marry me! No, Tattleaid. He that is so
mean as to marry a woman after an affair with her,
will be so base as to upbraid that very weakness. He
that marries his wench will use her like his wench.&mdash;Such
a pair must sure live in a secret mutual scorn of
each other; and wedlock is hell if at least one side
does not love, as it would be Heaven if both did; and
I believe it so much Heaven, as to think it was never
enjoyed in this world.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Go to him.&mdash;Bless me, how careless and open
have I been to this subtle creature in the case of Cabinet;
she's certainly in his interests&mdash;&mdash;We people of condition
are never guarded enough against those about us. They
watch when our minds boil over with joy or grief, to
come in upon us. How miserable it is to have one one
hates always about one, and when one can't endure one's
own reflection upon some actions, who can bear the
thoughts of another upon 'em? But she has me by deep,
deep secrets.&mdash;The Italians, they say, can readily remove
the too much intrusted&mdash;&mdash;Oh! their pretty scented
gloves! This wench I know has played me false and
horned me in my gallants. O Italy, I could resign all
my female English liberty to thee, for thy much dearer
female pleasure, revenge!</p>

<p>Well, what's the matter, dear Tatty?</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> The matter, madam? why, madam, Counsellor
Puzzle is come to wait on your ladyship about the will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and the conveyance of the estate. There must, it seems,
be no time lost for fear of things. Fie, fie, madam, you
a widow these three hours and not looked on a parchment
yet&mdash;&mdash;Oh, impious, to neglect the will of the
dead!</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> As you say, indeed, there is no will of an husband's
so willingly obeyed as his last. But I must go in
and receive him in my formalities, leaning on a couch, as
necessary a posture as his going behind his desk when he
speaks to a client&mdash;&mdash;But do you bring him in hither till
I am ready. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> I told my lady twice or thrice, as she lies in
dumb grief on the couch within, that you were here, but
she regarded me not; however, since you say 'tis of such
moment, I'll venture to introduce you. Please but to
repose here a little while I step in; for methinks I would
a little prepare her.</p>

<p><i>Puz.</i> Alas! alas! Poor lady! [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Tattleaid</span>.
Damned hypocrites! Well, this noble's death is a little
sudden. Therefore, pray, let me recollect. Open the
bag, good Tom. Now, Tom, thou art my nephew, my
dear sister Kate's only son and my heir, therefore I will
conceal from thee on no occasion anything, for I would
enter thee into business as soon as possible. Know
then, child, that the lord of this house was one of your
men of honour and sense who lose the latter in the
former, and are apt to take all men to be like themselves.
Now this gentleman entirely trusted me, and I made
the only use a man of business can of a trust&mdash;I cheated
him. For I, imperceptibly, before his face, made his
whole estate liable to an hundred per annum for myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
for good services, &amp;c. As for legacies, they are good or
not as I please; for, let me tell you, a man must take
pen, ink, and paper, sit down by an old fellow, and pretend
to take directions; but a true lawyer never makes
any man's will but his own; and as the priest of old
among us got near the dying man and gave all to the
church, so now the lawyer gives all to the law.</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> Ay, sir; but priests then cheated the nation by
doing their offices in an unknown language.</p>

<p><i>Puz.</i> True; but ours is a way much surer, for we
cheat in no language at all, but loll in our own coaches,
eloquent in gibberish, and learned in juggle&mdash;&mdash;Pull out
the parchment; there's the deed, I made it as long as I
could. Well, I hope to see the day when the indenture
shall be the exact measure of the land that passes by it;
for 'tis a discouragement to the gown that every ignorant
rogue of an heir should, in a word or two, understand his
father's meaning, and hold ten acres of land by half-an-acre
of parchment. Nay, I hope to see the time when
that there is, indeed, some progress made in, shall be
wholly effected, and by the improvement of the noble
art of tautology every inn in Holborn an inn of court.
Let others think of logic, rhetoric and I know not what
impertinence, but mind thou tautology. What's the first
excellence in a lawyer? Tautology. What the second?
Tautology. What the third? Tautology&mdash;as an old
pleader said of action. But turn to the deed [<i>pulls out
an immeasurable parchment</i>], for the will is of no force if
I please, for he was not capable of making one after the
former&mdash;as I managed it; upon which account I now
wait upon my lady. By the way, do you know the true
meaning of the word, a deed?</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> Ay, sir; a deed is as if a man should say the
deed.</p>

<p><i>Puz.</i> Right. 'Tis emphatically so-called because after
it all deeds and actions are of no effect, and you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
nothing to do but hang yourself, the only obliging thing
you can then do&mdash;&mdash;But I was telling you the use of
tautology. Read toward the middle of that instrument.</p>

<p><i>Clerk</i> [<i>reads</i>]. "I, the said Earl of Brumpton, do
give, bestow, grant, and bequeath, over and above the
said premises, all the site and capital messuage called by
the name of Oatham, and all out-houses, barns, stables,
and other edifices and buildings, yards, orchards, gardens,
fields, arbours, trees, lands, earths, meadows, greens,
pastures, feedings, woods, underwoods, ways, waters,
watercourses, fishings, ponds, pools, commons, common
of pasture, paths, heath-thickets, profits, commodities
and emoluments, with their and every of their appurtenances
[<span class="smcap">Puzzle</span> <i>nods and sneers as the synonimous words
are repeating, whom</i> <span class="smcap">Lord B.</span> <i>scornfully mimics</i>] whatsoever,
to the said capital messuage and site belonging, or
in any wise appertaining, or with the same heretofore
used, occupied or enjoyed, accepted, executed, known, or
taken as part, parcel, or member of the same; containing
in the whole, by estimation, four hundred acres of the
large measure, or thereabouts, be the same more or less;
all and singular, which the said site, capital messuage, and
other the premises, with their and every of their
appurtenances are situate, lying, and being&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Puz.</i> Hold, hold, good Tom; you do come on indeed
in business, but don't use your nose enough in reading.
[<i>Reads in a ridiculous law-tone until out of breath.</i>] Why,
you're quite out&mdash;You read to be understood. Let me
see it.&mdash;"I, the said Earl."&mdash;Now again, suppose this
were to be in Latin. [<i>Runs into Latin terminations.</i>]
Making Latin is only making it no English&mdash;"<i>Ego
predict&mdash;Comes de Brumpton&mdash;totas meas barnos&mdash;outhousas
et stabulas&mdash;yardos</i>"&mdash;But there needs no further
perusal&mdash;I now recollect the whole. My lord, by this
instrument, disinherits his son utterly, gives all to my
lady, and moreover, grants the wards of two fortune-wards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
to her&mdash;<i>id est</i>, to be sold by her, which is the
subject of my business to her ladyship, who, methinks, a
little overdoes the affair of grief, in letting me wait thus
long on such welcome articles. But here&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Tattleaid</span>, <i>wiping her eyes.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tat.</i> I have in vain done all I can to make her regard
me. Pray, Mr. Puzzle&mdash;you're a man of sense&mdash;come
in yourself, and speak reason, to bring her to some
consideration of herself, if possible.</p>

<p><i>Puz.</i> Tom, I'll come down to the hall to you; dear
madam, lead on.</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> Trusty, on thy sincerity, on thy fidelity to me,
thy friend, thy patron, and thy master, answer me directly
to one question: am I really alive? Am I that identical,
that numerical, that very same Lord Brumpton,
that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> That very lord&mdash;that very Lord Brumpton, the
very generous, honest, and good Lord Brumpton, who
spent his strong and riper years with honour and reputation;
but in his age of decay declined from virtue also.
That very Lord Brumpton, who buried a fine lady who
brought him a fine son, who is a fine gentleman; but in
his age, that very man, unreasonably captivated with youth
and beauty, married a very fine young lady, who has dishonoured
his bed, disinherited his brave son, and dances
o'er his grave.</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> Oh! that damned tautologist, too&mdash;that
Puzzle and his irrevocable deed! [<i>Pausing.</i>] Well, I
know I do not really live, but wander o'er the place
where once I had a treasure. I'll haunt her, Trusty, gaze
in that false beauteous face, till she trembles&mdash;till she
looks pale&mdash;nay, till she blushes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> Ay, ay, my lord, you speak a ghost very much;
there's flesh and blood in that expression, that false
beauteous face!</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> Then since you see my weakness, be a friend,
and arm me with all your care and all your reason&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> If you'll condescend to let me direct you&mdash;you
shall cut off this rotten limb, your false disloyal wife, and
save your noble parts, your son, your family, your
honour.</p>

<h3>ACT THE SECOND.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Hardy's</span> <i>Lodgings.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Hardy</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Now, indeed, I am utterly undone;
but to expect an evil softens
the weight of it when it happens, and
pain no more than pleasure is in
reality so great as in expectation.
But what will become of me? How
shall I keep myself even above
worldly want? Shall I live at home a stiff, melancholy,
poor man of quality, grow uneasy to my acquaintance as
well as myself, by fancying I'm slighted where I am not;
with all the thousand particularities which attend those
whom low fortune and high spirit make malcontents?
No! We've a brave prince on the throne, whose commission
I bear, and a glorious war in an honest cause
approaching [<i>clapping his hand on his sword</i>], in which
this shall cut bread for me, and may perhaps equal that
estate to which my birth entitled me. But what to do
in present pressures&mdash;Ha! Trim. [<i>Calling.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Trim</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Trim.</i> My lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> How do the poor rogues that are to recruit
my Company?</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Do, sir! They've ate you to your last guinea.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Were you at the agent's?</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Well? And how?</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Why, sir, for your arrears, you may have eleven
shillings in the pound; but he'll not touch your growing
subsistence under three shillings in the pound interest;
besides which you must let his clerk, Jonathan Item,
swear the peace against you to keep you from duelling&mdash;or
insure your life, which you may do for eight per cent.
On these terms he'll oblige you, which he would not do
for anybody else in the regiment; but he has a friendship
for you.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Oh, I'm his humble servant; but he must have
his own terms. We can't starve, nor must my fellows
want. But methinks this is a calm midnight, I've heard
no duns to-day&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Duns, my lord? Why now your father's dead,
and they can't arrest you. I shall grow a little less upon
the smooth with 'em than I have been. Why, friend,
says I, how often must I tell you my lord is not stirring:
His lordship has not slept well, you must come some
other time; your lordship will send for him when you are
at leisure to look upon money-affairs; or if they are so
saucy, so impertinent as to press to a man of your quality
for their own&mdash;there are canes, there's Bridewell, there's
the stocks for your ordinary tradesmen. But to an
haughty, thriving Covent Garden mercer, silk or laceman,
your lordship gives your most humble service to
him, hopes his wife's well. You have letters to write, or
you'd see him yourself, but you desire he would be with
you punctually such a day, that is to say the day after
you are gone out of town.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Go, sirrah, you're scurrilous; I won't believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
there are such men of quality. D'ye hear, give my
service this afternoon to Mr. Cutpurse, the agent, and
tell him I'm obliged to him for his readiness to serve me,
for I'm resolved to pay my debts forthwith&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>A voice without.</i> I don't know whether he is within
or not. Mr. Trim, is my lord within?]</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Trim, see who it is. I ain't within, you
know. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Trim</span>.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> [<i>Without.</i>] Yes, sir, my lord's above; pray
walk up&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Who can it be? he owns me, too.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Campley</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Trim</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dear Tom Campley, this is kind! You are an extraordinary
man indeed, who in the sudden accession of a
noble fortune can be still yourself, and visit your less
happy friends.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> No; you are, my lord, the extraordinary man,
who, on the loss of an almost princely fortune, can be
master of a temper that makes you the envy, rather
than pity, of your more fortunate, not more happy
friends.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> O, sir, your servant&mdash;but let me gaze on
thee a little, I han't seen thee since I came home into
England&mdash;most exactly, negligently, genteelly dressed!
I know there's more than ordinary in this [<i>beating</i> <span class="smcap">Campley's</span>
<i>breast</i>]. Come, confess, who shares with me
here? I must have her real and poetical name. Come;
she's in sonnet, Cynthia; in prose, mistress.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> One you little dream of, though she is in a
manner of your placing there.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> My placing there?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Why, my lord, all the fine things you've said to
me in the camp of my Lady Sharlot, your father's ward,
ran in my head so very much, that I made it my business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
to become acquainted in that family, which I did by
Mr. Cabinet's means, and am now in love in the same
place with your lordship.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> How? in love in the same place with me, Mr.
Campley?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Ay, my lord, with t'other sister&mdash;with t'other
sister.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> What a dunce was I, not to know which, without
your naming her! Why, thou art the only man
breathing fit to deal with her. But my Lady Sharlot,
there's a woman&mdash;so easily virtuous! So agreeably
severe! Her motion so unaffected, yet so composed!
Her lips breathe nothing but truth, good sense, and
flowing wit.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Lady Harriot! there's the woman; such life,
such spirit, such warmth in her eyes; such a lively commanding
air in her glances; so spritely a mien, that
carries in it the triumph of conscious beauty; her lips
are made of gum and balm. There's something in that
dear girl that fires my blood above&mdash;above&mdash;above&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Above what?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> A grenadier's march.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> A soft simile, I must confess! but oh that
Sharlot! to recline this aching head, full of care, on that
tender, snowy&mdash;faithful bosom!</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> O that Harriot! to embrace that beauteous<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Ay, Tom; but methinks your head runs too
much on the wedding night only, to make your happiness
lasting; mine is fixed on the married state. I
expect my felicity from Lady Sharlot, in her friendship,
her constancy, her piety, her household cares, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
maternal tenderness. You think not of any excellence
of your mistress that is more than skin-deep&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> When I know her further than skin-deep I'll
tell you more of my mind.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> O fie, Tom, how can you talk so lightly of
a woman you love with honour.&mdash;But tell me, I wonder
how you make your approaches in besieging such a sort
of creature&mdash;she that loves addresses, gallantry, fiddles;
that reigns and delights in a crowd of admirers. If I
know her, she is one of those you may easily have a
general acquaintance with, but hard to make particular.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> You understand her very well. You must
know I put her out of all her play by carrying it in a
humourous manner. I took care in all my actions,
before I discovered the lover, that she should in general
have a good opinion of me; and have ever since behaved
myself with all the good humour and ease I was able;
so that she is now extremely at a loss how to throw me
from the familiarity of an acquaintance into the distance
of a lover; but I laugh her out of it. When she begins
to frown and look grave at my mirth, I mimic her till
she bursts out a-laughing.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> That's ridiculous enough.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> By Cabinet's interest over my Lady Brumpton,
with gold and flattery to Mrs. Fardingale, an old maid
her ladyship has placed about the young ladies, I have
easy access at all times, and am this very day to be
admitted by her into their apartment. I have found,
you must know, that she is my relation.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Her ladyship has chose an odd companion
for young ladies.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Oh, my lady's a politician. She told Tattleaid
one day, that an old maid was the best guard for young
ones, for they, like eunuchs in a seraglio, are vigilant out
of envy of enjoyments they cannot themselves arrive at.
But, as I was saying, I've sent my cousin Fardingale a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
song, which she and I are to practise to the spinet. The
young ladies will be by; and I am to be left alone with
Lady Harriot; then I design to make my grand attack,
and to-day win or lose her. I know, sir, this is an
opportunity you want. If you'll meet me at Tom's,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> have
a letter ready, I'll myself deliver it to your mistress, conduct
you into the house, and tell her you are there&mdash;and
find means to place you together. You must march
under my command to-day, as I have many a one under
yours.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> But 'faith, Tom, I shall not behave myself
with half the resolution you have under mine, for to confess
my weakness, though I know she loves me, though
I know she is as steadfastly mine as her heart can make
her; I know not how, I have so sublime an idea of her
high value, and such a melting tenderness dissolves my
whole frame when I am near her, that my tongue falters,
my nerves shake, and my heart so alternately sinks
and rises, that my premeditated resolves vanish into confusion,
down-cast eyes, and broken utterance&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Ha! ha! ha! this in a campaigner too! Why,
my lord, that's the condition Harriot would have me in,
and then she thinks she could have me; but I, that
know her better than she does herself, know she'd insult
me, and lead me a two years' dance longer, and perhaps
in the end turn me into the herd of the many neglected
men of better sense, who have been ridiculous for her
sake. But I shall make her no such sacrifice. 'Tis well
my Lady Sharlot's a woman of so solid an understanding;
I don't know another that would not use you ill for your
high value.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> But, Tom, I must see your song you've sent
your cousin Fardingale, as you call her.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> This is lucky enough [<i>Aside</i>]. No; hang it, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
lord, a man makes so silly a figure when his verses are
reading. Trim&mdash;thou hast not left off thy loving and
thy rhyming; Trim's a critic, I remember him a servitor
at Oxon [<i>Gives a paper to</i> <span class="smcap">Trim</span>]. I give myself into his
hands, because you shan't see 'em till I'm gone. My
lord, your servant, you shan't stir.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Nor you neither then. [<i>Struggling.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> You will be obeyed.
[<i>Exeunt.</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Hardy</span> <i>waits on him down.</i></p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> What's in this song? Ha! don't my eyes deceive
me&mdash;a bill of three hundred pounds&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Cash</span>,</p>

<p>"Pray pay to Mr. William Trim, or bearer, the sum of
three hundred pounds, and place it to the account of,</p>

<p>"Sir,</p>

<p>"Your humble servant,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Thomas Campley</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>[<i>Pulling off his hat and bowing.</i>] Your very humble
servant, good Mr. Campley. Ay, this is poetry&mdash;this is
a song indeed! Faith, I'll set it, and sing it myself.
Pray pay to Mr. William Trim&mdash;so far in recitativo&mdash;three
hundred [<i>singing ridiculously</i>]&mdash;hun&mdash;dred&mdash;hundred&mdash;hundred
thrice repeated, because 'tis three hundred
pounds&mdash;I love repetitions in music, when there's a
good reason for it,&mdash;po&mdash;unds after the Italian manner.
If they'd bring me such sensible words as these, I'd outstrip
all your composers for the music prize. This was
honestly done of Mr. Campley, though I have carried
him many a purse from my master when he was ensign
to our Company in Flanders&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Hardy</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>My lord, I am your lordship's humble servant.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Sir, your humble servant. But pray, my good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
familiar friend, how come you to be so very much my
humble servant all of a sudden?</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> I beg pardon, dear sir, my lord, I am not your
humble servant.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> No!</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Yes, my lord, I am, but not as you mean; but
I am&mdash;I am, my lord&mdash;in short, I'm overjoyed.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Overjoyed! thou'rt distracted, what ails the
fellow? Where's Campley's song?</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Oh! my lord, one would not think 'twas in
him. Mr. Campley's really a very great poet; as for the
song, 'tis only as they all end in rhyme:
Ow&mdash;woe&mdash;isses&mdash;kisses&mdash;boy&mdash;joy. But, my lord, the other in long
heroic blank verse.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Reading it with a great tone.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Pray pay to Mr. William Trim, or order, the sum of&mdash;How
sweetly it runs! Pactolian guineas chink every
line.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> How very handsomely this was done in
Campley! I wondered, indeed, he was so willing to
show his verses. In how careless a manner that fellow
does the greatest actions!</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> My lord, pray my lord, shan't I go immediately
to Cutpurse's?</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> No, sirrah, now we have no occasion for it.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> No, my lord, only to stare him full in the face
after I have received this money, not say a word, but
keep my hat on, and walk out. Or perhaps not hear, if
any I meet with speak to me, but grow stiff, deaf, and
shortsighted to all my old acquaintance, like a sudden
rich man as I am. Or, perhaps, my lord, desire Cutpurse's
clerk to let me leave fifty pounds at their house, payable
to Mr. William Trim, or order, till I come that way, or,
a month or two hence, may have occasion for it: I
don't know what bills may be drawn upon me. Then
when the clerk begins to stare at me, till he pulls the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
great goose-quill from behind his ear [<i>Pulls a handfull of
farthings out</i>] I fall a-reckoning the pieces as I do these
farthings.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Well, sirrah, you may have your humour, but
be sure you take four score pounds, and pay my debts
immediately. If you meet any officer you ever see me
in company with, that looks grave at Cutpurse's house,
tell him I'd speak with him: We must help our friends.
But learn moderation, you rogue, in your good fortune;
be at home all the evening after, while I wait at Tom's
to meet Campley, in order to see Lady Sharlot.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My good or ill in her alone is found,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And in that thought all other cares are drowned.</span><br />

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sable, Lord Brumpton</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Trusty</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sab.</i> Why, my lord, you can't in conscience put me
off so. I must do according to my orders, cut you up, and
embalm you, except you'll come down a little deeper
than you talk of; you don't consider the charges I have
been at already.</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> Charges! for what?</p>

<p><i>Sab.</i> First, twenty guineas to my lady's woman for notice
of your death (a fee I've, before now, known the widow
herself go halves in), but no matter for that. In the next
place, ten pounds for watching you all your long fit of
sickness last winter.</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> Watching me? Why I had none but my own
servants by turns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sab.</i> I mean attending to give notice of your death. I
had all your long fit of sickness last winter, at half-a-crown
a day, a fellow waiting at your gate to bring me
intelligence, but you unfortunately recovered, and I lost
my obliging pains for your service.</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> Ha! ha! ha! Sable, thou art a very impudent
fellow; half-a-crown a day to attend my decease, and dost
thou reckon it to me?</p>

<p><i>Sab.</i> Look you, gentlemen, don't stand staring at me.
I have a book at home which I call my Doomsday book,
where I have every man of quality's age and distemper
in town, and know when you should drop. Nay, my
lord, if you had reflected upon your mortality half so
much as poor I have for you, you would not desire to
return to life thus; in short, I cannot keep this a secret,
under the whole money I am to have for burying you.</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> Trusty, if you think it safe in you to obey my
orders after the deed Puzzle told his clerk of, pay it to
him.</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> I should be glad to give it out of my own
pocket, rather than be without the satisfaction of seeing
you witness to it.</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> I heartily believe thee, dear Trusty.</p>

<p><i>Sab.</i> Then, my lord, the secret of your being alive, is
now safe with me.</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> I'll warrant I'll be revenged of this unconscionable
dog [<i>Aside</i>]&mdash;My lord, you must to your closet, I fear
somebody's coming.

forbear laughing [<i>Looking over</i> <span class="smcap">Sharlot</span>]. Oh, I see his
name as plain as you do&mdash;F&mdash;r&mdash;a&mdash;n Fran, c&mdash;i&mdash;s cis,
Francis, 'tis in every line of the book.</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> [<i>Rising</i>] 'Tis in vain, I see, to mind anything
in such impertinent company, but granting 'twere as you
say as to my Lord Hardy, 'tis more excusable to admire
another than one's self.</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> No, I think not; yes, I grant you than really
to be vain at one's person, but I don't admire myself.
Pish! I don't believe my eyes have that softness [<i>Looking
in the glass</i>], they ain't so piercing. No, 'tis only stuff the
men will be talking. Some people are such admirers of
teeth. Lord, what signifies teeth? [<i>Showing her teeth.</i>]
A very black-a-moor has as white teeth as I. No, sister,
I don't admire myself, but I've a spirit of contradiction
in me; I don't know I'm in love myself, only to rival the
men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> Ay, but Mr. Campley will gain ground even of
that rival of his, your dear self.</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> Oh! what have I done to you, that you should
name that insolent intruder, a confident opinionative fop.
No indeed, if I am, as a poetical lover of mine sighed
and sung of both sexes&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The public envy, and the public care,</span><br />
</p>

<p>I shan't be so easily catched&mdash;I thank him&mdash;I want but
to be sure I should heartily torment him, by banishing
him, and then consider whether he should depart this
life, or not.</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> Indeed, sister, to be serious with you, this
vanity in your humour does not at all become you!</p>

<p><i>La. H.</i> Vanity! All the matter is we gay people are
more sincere than you wise folks: All your life's an art.
Speak your soul&mdash;look you there&mdash;[<i>Haling her to the glass</i>]
are not you struck with a secret pleasure, when you view
that bloom in your looks, that harmony in your shape,
that promptitude of your mien?</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> Well, simpleton, if I am at first so silly, as to
be a little taken with myself, I know it a fault, and take
pains to correct it.</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> Pshaw! pshaw! talk this musty tale to old
Mrs. Fardingale, 'tis too soon for me to think at that
rate.</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> They that think it too soon to understand
themselves, will very soon find it too late. But tell me
honestly, don't you like Campley?</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> The fellow is not to be abhorred, if the forward
thing did not think of getting me so easily. Oh! I hate
a heart I can't break when I please. What makes the
value of dear china, but that 'tis so brittle? Were it not
for that, you might as well have stone mugs in your
closet.</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> Hist, hist, here's Fardingale.</p>

<p><i>Far.</i> Lady Harriot, Lady Sharlot! I'll entertain you
now, I've a new song just come hot out of the poet's
brain. Lady Sharlot, my cousin Campley writ it, and 'tis
set to a pretty air, I warrant you.</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> 'Tis like to be pretty indeed, of his writing.
[<i>Flings away.</i></p>

<p><i>Far.</i> Come, come, this is not one of your tringham
trangham witty things, that your poor poets write; no,
'tis well known my cousin Campley has two thousand
pounds a year. But this is all dissimulation in you.</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> 'Tis so, indeed, for your cousin's song is very
pretty, Mrs. Fardingale.</p>

one without enduring t'other.</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> Pish&mdash;the familiar coxcomb frets me heartily.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> 'Twill over, I hope, immediately.</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> Your cousin Fardingale has shown us some of
your poetry; there's the spinet, Mr. Campley, I know
you're musical.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> She should not have called it my poetry.</p>

<p><i>Far.</i> No&mdash;who waits there&mdash;pray bring my lute out of
the next room.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>with a Lute.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>You must know I conned this song before I came in, and
find it will go to an excellent air of old Mr. Lawes's<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>, who
was my mother's intimate acquaintance; my mother's,

the lute; cousin Campley, hold the song upon your hat.&mdash;[<i>Aside

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Let not love, &amp;c.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Oh! I have left off these things many a day.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> No; I profess, madam, you do it admirably,
but are not assured enough. Take it higher [<i>in her own
squall</i>]. Thus&mdash;I know your voice will bear it.</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> O hideous! O the gross flatterer&mdash;I shall
burst. Mrs. Fardingale, pray go on, the music fits the
words most aptly. Take it higher, as your cousin advises.</p>

<p><i>Far.</i> Oh! dear madam, do you really like it? I do it
purely to please you, for I can't sing, alas!</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> We know it, good madam, we know it. But
pray&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Far.</i> "Let not love," and "substantial blisses," is lively
enough, and ran accordingly in the tune. [<i>Curtsies to
the company.</i>] Now I took it higher.</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> Incomparably done! Nothing can equal it,
except your cousin sang his own poetry.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Madam, from my Lord Hardy. [<i>Delivers a
letter to</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Sharlot</span>.]&mdash;How do you say, my Lady
Harriot, except I sing it myself? Then I assure you I
will&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> I han't patience. I must go read my letter.
[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> [<i>Sings</i>] Let not love, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Far.</i> Bless me, what's become of Lady Sharlot? [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> Mrs. Fardingale, Mrs. Fardingale, what, must
we lose you? [<i>Going after her.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Campley</span> <i>runs to the door, takes the key out, and locks
her in.</i></p>

<p>What means this insolence? a plot upon me&mdash;Do you
know who I am?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Yes, madam, you're my Lady Harriot Lovely,
with ten thousand pounds in your pocket; and I am
Mr. Campley, with two thousand a year, of quality
enough to pretend to you. And I do design, before I
leave this room, to hear you talk like a reasonable
woman, as nature has made you. Nay, 'tis in vain to
flounce, and discompose yourself and your dress.</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> If there are swords, if they are men of honour,
and not all dastards, cowards that pretend to this injured
person&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Running
round the room.</i></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Ay, ay, madam, let 'em come. That's putting
me in my way, fighting's my trade; but you've used all
mankind too ill to expect so much service. In short,
madam, were you a fool I should not desire to expostulate
with you. [<i>Seizing her hand.</i>] But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> Unhand me, ravisher. [<i>Pulls her hand from
him, chases round the room,</i> <span class="smcap">Campley</span> <i>after her.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> But madam, madam, madam, why madam!</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Prithee Cynthia look behind you, [<i>Sings.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Age and wrinkles will o'ertake you.</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> Age, wrinkles, small-pox, nay, anything that's
most abhorrent to youth and bloom, were welcome in
the place of so detested a creature.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> No such matter, Lady Harriot. I would not be
a vain coxcomb, but I know I am not detestable, nay,
know where you've said as much before you understood
me for your servant. Was I immediately transformed
because I became your lover?</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> My lover, sir! did I ever give you reason to
think I admitted you as such?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Yes, you did in your using me ill; for if you
did not assume upon the score of my pretending to you,
how do you answer to yourself some parts of your behaviour
to me as a gentleman? 'Tis trivial, all this, in
you, and derogates from the good sense I know you
mistress of. Do but consider, madam, I have long loved
you, bore with your fantastic humour through all its
mazes. Nay, do not frown, for 'tis no better. I say I
have bore with this humour, but would you have me
with an unmanly servitude feed it? No, I love you
with too sincere, too honest a devotion, and would
have your mind as faultless as your person, which
'twould be, if you'd lay aside this vanity of being pursued
with sighs, with flatteries, with nonsense [<i>She
walks about less violently, but more confused.</i>]&mdash;Oh! my
heart aches at the disturbance which I give her, but she
must not see it. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Had I not better tell you of it
now, than when your are in my power? I should be then
too generous to thwart your inclination.</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> That is indeed very handsomely said. Why
should I not obey reason as soon as I see it? [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
so, Mr. Campley, I can as ingenuously as I should
then, acknowledge that I have been in an error.
[<i>Looking down on her fan.</i></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Nay, that's too great a condescension. Oh!
excellence! I repent! I see 'twas but justice in you
to demand my knees [<i>kneeling</i>], my sighs, my constant,
tenderest regard and service. And you shall have 'em,
since you are above 'em.</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> Nay, Mr. Campley, you won't recall me to a
fault you have so lately shown me. I will not suffer
this&mdash;no more ecstasies! But pray, sir, what was't you
did to get my sister out of the room?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> You may know it, and I must desire you to
assist my Lord Hardy there, who writ to her by me; for
he is no ravisher, as you called me just now. He is
now in the house, and I would fain gain an interview.</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> That they may have, but they'll make little
use of it; for the tongue is the instrument of speech to
us of a lower form: They are of that high order of
lovers, who know none but eloquent silence, and can
utter themselves only by a gesture that speaks their
passion inexpressible, and what not fine things.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> But pray let's go into your sister's closet while
they are together.</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> I swear I don't know how to see my sister&mdash;she'll
laugh me to death to see me out of my pantofles,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and
you and I thus familiar. However, I know she'll approve it.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> You may boast yourself an heroine to her, and
the first woman that was ever vanquished by hearing
truth, and had sincerity enough to receive so rough an
obligation as being made acquainted with her faults.
Come, madam, stand your ground bravely, we'll march
in to her thus. [<i>She leaning on</i> <span class="smcap">Campley</span>.</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> Who'll believe a woman's anger more? I've
betrayed the whole sex to you, Mr. Campley. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Hardy</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Campley</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cam.</i> My lord, her sister, who now is mine, will immediately
send her hither. But be yourself: Charge
her bravely. I wish she were a cannon, an eighteen-pounder,
for your sake. Then I know, were there occasion,
you'd be in the mouth of her.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> I long, yet fear to see her. I know I am
unable to utter myself.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Come, retire here till she appears.
[<i>They go back to the door.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Sharlot</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> Now is the tender moment now approaching.
[<i>Aside.</i>] There he is. [<i>They approach and salute each
other trembling.</i>] Your lordship will please to sit. [<i>After
a very long pause, stolen glances, and irresolute gesture.</i>]
Your lordship, I think, has travelled those parts of Italy
where the armies are.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Yes, madam.</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> I think I have letters from you, dated Mantua.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> I hope you have, madam, and that their purpose&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> My lord? [<i>Looking serious and confused.</i></p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Was not your ladyship going to say something?</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> I only attended to what your lordship was
going to say&mdash;That is, my lord&mdash;But you were, I
believe, going to say something of that garden of the
world, Italy. I am very sorry your misfortunes in England
are such as make you justly regret your leaving that
place.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> There is a person in England may make those
losses insensible to me.</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> Indeed, my lord, there have so very few of
quality attended his Majesty in the war, that your birth
and merit may well hope for his favour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> I have, indeed, all the zeal in the world for
his Majesty's service, and most grateful affection for his
person, but did not then mean him.</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> But can you indeed impartially say that our
island is really preferable to the rest of the world, or is
it an arrogance only in us to think so?</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> I profess, madam, that little I have seen has
but more endeared England to me; for that medley
of humours which perhaps distracts our public affairs,
does, methinks, improve our private lives, and makes
conversation more various, and consequently more
pleasing. Everywhere else both men and things have
the same countenance. In France you meet much
civility and little friendship; in Holland, deep attention,
but little reflection; in Italy, all pleasure, but no mirth.
But here with us, where you have everywhere pretenders
or masters in everything, you can't fall into company
wherein you shall not be instructed or diverted.</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> I never had an account of anything from you,
my lord, but I mourned the loss of my brother; you
would have been so happy a companion for him, with
that right sense of yours. My lord, you need not bow
so obsequiously, for I do you but justice. But you sent
me word of your seeing a lady in Italy very like me.
Did you visit her often?</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Once or twice, but I observed her so loose a
creature, that I could have killed her for having your
person.</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> I thank you, sir; but Heaven that preserves
me unlike her, will, I hope, make her more like me.
But your fellow traveller&mdash;his relations themselves
know not a just account of him.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> The original cause of his fever was a violent
passion for a fine young woman he had not power to
speak to, but I told her his regard for her as passionately
as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> You were to him what Mr. Campley has been
to you&mdash;Whither am I running?&mdash;Poor, your friend&mdash;poor
gentleman&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> I hope then as Campley's eloquence is greater,
so has been his success.</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> My lord?</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Your ladyship's&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Harriot</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> Undone! Undone! Tattleaid has found, by
some means or other, that Campley brought my Lord
Hardy hither; we are utterly ruined, my lady's coming.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> I'll stay and confront her.</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> It must not be; we are too much in her
power.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Campley</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Come, come, my lord, we're routed horse and
foot. Down the back stairs, and so out.</p>

<p><i>Ladies.</i> Ay, ay. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> I tremble every joint of me.</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> I'm at a stand a little, but rage will recover
me; she's coming in.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Widow</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Ladies, your servant. I fear I interrupt you;
have you company? Lady Harriot, your servant;
Lady Sharlot, your servant. What, not a word? Oh,
I beg your ladyship's pardon. Lady Sharlot, did I
say? My young Lady Brumpton, I wish you joy.</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> Oh, your servant, Lady Dowager Brumpton.
That's an appellation of much more joy to you.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> So smart, madam! but you should, methinks,
have made one acquainted&mdash;Yet, madam, your conduct
is seen through.</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> My conduct, Lady Brumpton!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Your conduct, Lady Sharlot!
[<i>Coming up to each other.</i></p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> Madam, 'tis you are seen through all your thin
disguises.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> I seen? By whom?</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> By an all-piercing eye, nay, by what you much
more fear, the eye of the world. The world sees you,
or shall see you. It shall know your secret intemperance,
your public fasting&mdash;Loose poems in your
closet, an homily on your toilet&mdash;Your easy, skilful,
practised hypocrisy, by which you wrought upon your
husband, basely to transfer the trust and ward of us,
two helpless virgins, into the hands and care of&mdash;I
cannot name it. You're a wicked woman.</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] O rare sister! 'Tis a fine thing to
keep one's anger in stock by one. We that are angry
and pleased every half-hour have nothing at all of all
this high-flown fury! Why, she rages like a princess in
a tragedy! Blessings on her tongue.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Is this the effect of your morning lectures, your
self-examination, all this fury?</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> Yes it is, madam; if I take pains to govern
my passions, it shall not give licence to others to
govern them for me.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Well, Lady Sharlot, however you ill deserve it
of me, I shall take care, while there are locks and
bars, to keep you from Lord Hardy&mdash;from being a
leager lady, from carrying a knapsack.</p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> Knapsack! Do you upbraid the poverty
your own wicked arts have brought him to? Knapsack!
O grant me patience! Can I hear this of the
man I love? Knapsack! I have not words.
[<i>Stamps about the room.</i></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> I leave you to cool upon it; love and anger are
very warm passions. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> She has locked us in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p><i>L. Sh.</i> Knapsack? Well, I will break walls to go to
him. I could sit down and cry my eyes out! Dear
sister, what a rage have I been in? Knapsack! I'll
give vent to my just resentment. Oh, how shall I avoid
this base woman; how meet that excellent man! What
an helpless condition are you and I in now! If we run
into the world, that youth and innocence which should
demand assistance does but attract invaders. Will
Providence guard us? How do I see that our sex is
naturally indigent of protection! I hope 'tis in fate to
crown our loves; for 'tis only in the protection of men
of honour that we are naturally truly safe&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And woman's happiness, for all her scorn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is only by that side whence she was born.</span><br />

<h3>ACT THE THIRD.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Hardy's</span> <i>Lodgings.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Hardy, Campley</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Trim</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> That jade Tattleaid saw me
upon the stairs, for I had not patience
to keep my concealment, but
must peep out to see what was become
of you.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> But we have advice, however,
it seems, from the garrison already&mdash;this
mistress of Trim's is a mighty lucky accident.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Ay, gentlemen, she has free egress and regress,
and you know the French are the best-bred people in
the world&mdash;she'll be assistant. But, 'faith, I have one
scruple that hangs about me; and that is, look you, my
lord, we servants have no masters in their absence. In
a word, when I am with mademoiselle I talk of your
lordship as only a particular acquaintance; that I do
business indeed for you sometimes. I must needs say,
cries I, that indeed my Lord Hardy is really a person
I have a great honour for.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Pish! is that all? I understand you; your
mistress does not know that you do me the honour to
clean my shoes or so, upon occasion. Pr'ythee, Will,
make yourself as considerable as you please.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Well, then, your lesson is this. She, out of
respect to me, and understanding Mr. Campley was an
intimate of my friend, my Lord Hardy, and condescending
(though she is of a great house in France) to make
manteaus for the improvement of the English&mdash;which
gives her easy admittance&mdash;she, I say, moved by these
promises,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> has vouchsafed to bring a letter from my
Lady Harriot to Mr. Campley, and came to me to bring
her to him. You are to understand also that she is dressed
in the latest French cut; her dress is the model of their
habit, and herself of their manners. For she is&mdash;but you
shall see her. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> This gives me some life! Cheer up, Tom&mdash;but
behold the solemnity. Do you see Trim's gallantry?
I shall laugh out.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Trim</span> <i>leading in</i> <span class="smcap">Mademoiselle</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Trim.</i> My dear Lord Hardy, this is Mademoiselle
d'Epingle, whose name you've often heard me sigh.
[<span class="smcap">Lord Hardy</span> <i>salutes her.</i>] Mr. Campley&mdash;Mademoiselle
d'Epingle. [<span class="smcap">Campley</span> <i>salutes her.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mad.</i> Votre servante, gentlemen, votre servante.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> I protest to you I never saw anything so becoming
as your dress. Shall I beg the favour you'd
condescend to let Mr. Trim lead you once round the
room, that I may admire the elegance of your habit?
[<span class="smcap">Trim</span> <i>leads her round.</i></p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> How could you ask such a thing?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Pshaw, my lord, you are a bashful English
fellow. You see she is not surprised at it, but thinks me
gallant in desiring it. Oh, madam! your air! the
negligence, the disengagement of your manner! Oh how
delicate is your noble nation! I swear there's none but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the clumsy Dutch and English would oppose such polite
conquerors. When shall you see an Englishwoman so
dressed?</p>

<p><i>Mad.</i> De Englise! poor barbarians; poor savages;
dey know no more of de dress but to cover dere nakedness
[<i>Glides along the room</i>]. Dey be cloded, but no
dressed&mdash;But, Monsieur Terim, which Monsieur
Campley?</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> That's honest Tom Campley.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> At your service, mademoiselle.</p>

<p><i>Mad.</i> I fear I incur de censure [<i>Pulling out the letter,
and recollecting as loth to deliver it</i>], but Mr. Terim
being your intimate friend, and I designing to honour
him in de way of an husband&mdash;so&mdash;so&mdash;how do I run
away in discourse&mdash;I never make promise to Mr. Terim
before, and now to do it par accident&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Dear Will Trim is extremely obliging in having
prevailed upon you to do a thing that the severity of
your virtue, and the greatness of your quality (though a
stranger in the country you now honour by your
dwelling in it) would not let you otherwise condescend
to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mad.</i> Oh, monsieur! oh, monsieur! you speak my
very thoughts. Oh! I don't know how, pardon me, to
give a billet&mdash;it so look! O fie! I can no stay after
it. [<i>Drops it, runs affectedly to the other end of the room,
then quite out; re-enters.</i>] I beg ten tousand pardons for
go away to mal-propos. [<i>Curtsies as going.</i></p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Your servant, good madam. Mr. Trim, you
know you command here. Pray, if Madam d'Epingle
will honour our cottage with longer stay, wait on her in
and entertain her. Pray, sir, be free.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> My lord, you know your power over me; I'm
all complaisance. [<i>Leads her out.</i></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Now to my dear epistle&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"There is one thing which you were too generous to
touch upon in our last conversation. We have reason to
fear the Widow's practices in relation to our fortunes, if
you are not too quick for her. I ask Lady Sharlot
whether this is not her sense to Lord Hardy. She says
nothing, but lets me write on. These people always
have, and will have, admittance everywhere, therefore we
may hear from you.</p>

<p>"I am, sir,</p>

<p>"Your most obedient servant,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Harriot Lovely</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>My obedient servant! Thy obedience shall ever be as
voluntary as now&mdash;ten thousand thousand kisses on thee,
thou dear paper. Look you, my lord, what a pretty
hand it is?</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Why, Tom, thou dost not give me leave to see
it. You snatch it to your mouth so, you'll stifle the
poor lady.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Look you, my lord, all along the lines here
went the pen; and through them white intervals her
snowy fingers. Do you see, this is her name?</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Nay, there's Lady Sharlot's name, too, in the
midst of the letter. Why, you'll not be so unconscionable;
you're so greedy, you'll give me one kiss
sure?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Well, you shall; but you're so eager. Don't
bite me, for you shan't have it in your own hands.
There, there, there: Let go my hand.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> What an exquisite pleasure there is in this
foolery&mdash;but what shall we do?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> I have a thought; pry'thee, my lord, call
Trim.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Ha, Trim&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Hold, Mr. Trim. You forget his mistress is
there.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Gra'mercy! Dear Will Trim, step in hither.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Ay, that's something&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Trim</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Trim, have not I seen a young woman sometimes carry
Madam d'Epingle's trinkets for her, coming from my
Lady Brumpton's?</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Yes, you might have seen such a one; she
waits for her now.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Do you think you could not prevail for me to be
dressed in that wench's clothes, and attend your mistress
in her stead thither? They'll not dream we should so
soon attempt again&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Yes, I'll engage it.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Then we'll trust the rest to our good genius. I'll
about it instantly&mdash;Harriot Lovely&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Exit,
kissing the letter.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lady Brumpton's</span> <i>Room.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Widow</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Tattleaid</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Wid.</i> This was well done of you; be sure you take care
of their young ladyships; you shall, I promise you, have
a snip in the sale of 'em.</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> I thank your good ladyship.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Is that the porter's paper of how d'ye's?</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> Yes, madam, he just sent it up. His general
answer is, that you're as well as can be expected in your
condition, but that you see nobody.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> That's right. [<i>Reading names.</i>] Lady Riggle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Lady Formal&mdash;Oh! that Riggle, a pert ogler, an indiscreet
silly thing, who is really known by no man, yet for
her carriage, justly thought common to all; and as
Formal has only the appearance of virtue, so she has only
the appearance of vice. What chance, I wonder, put
these contradictions to each other into the same coach, as
you say they called? Mrs. Frances and Mrs. Winifred
Glebe&mdash;who are they?</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> They are the country great fortunes have been
out of town this whole year; they are those whom your
ladyship said upon being very well born took upon 'em
to be very ill bred.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Did I say so? really I think 'twas apt enough,
now I remember 'em. Lady Wrinkle&mdash;oh, that smug
old woman! There's no enduring her affectation of
youth, but I plague her; I always ask whether her
daughter in Wiltshire has a grandchild yet or not. Lady
Worthy&mdash;I can't bear her company, she has so much of
that virtue in her heart which I have in my mouth only.
[<i>Aside.</i>] Mrs. After-Day&mdash;oh that's she that was the
great beauty, the mighty toast about town&mdash;that's just
come out of the small-pox; she's horribly pitted they
say; I long to see her and plague her with my condolence.
'Tis a pure ill-natured satisfaction to see one that
was a beauty unfortunately move with the same languor
and softness of behaviour that once was charming in her&mdash;to
see, I say, her mortify that used to kill&mdash;ha! ha!
ha! The rest are a catalogue of mere names or titles
they were born to, an insipid crowd of neither good nor
bad; but you are sure these other ladies suspect not in
the least that I know of their coming?</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> No, dear madam, they are to ask for me.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> I hear a coach. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Tat</span>.] I've now an
exquisite pleasure in the thought of surpassing my Lady
Sly, who pretends to have out-grieved the whole town for
her husband. They are certainly coming.&mdash;Oh no! here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
let me&mdash;thus let me sit and think.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Widow</span> <i>on her couch;
while she is raving as to herself,</i> <span class="smcap">Tattleaid</span> <i>softly brings
in the ladies.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p>Wretched, disconsolate as I am! Oh
welcome, welcome, dear killing anguish! Oh, that I could
lie down and die in my present heaviness&mdash;but what&mdash;how?
Nay, my dear, dear lord, why do you look so
pale, so ghastly at me? Wottoo, wottoo, fright thy own
trembling, shivering wife&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> Nay, good madam, be comforted.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Thou shalt not have me. [<i>Pushes</i> <span class="smcap">Tat.</span></p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> Nay, good madam, 'tis I, 'tis I, your ladyship's
own woman&mdash;'tis I, madam, that dress you, and talk to
you, and tell you all that's done in the house every day;
'tis I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Is it, then, possible? Is it, then, possible that I
am left? Speak to me not&mdash;hold me not. I'll break the
listening walls with my complaints. [<i>Looks surprised at
seeing company, then severely at</i> <span class="smcap">Tattleaid</span>.] Ah!
Tattleaid&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>1st La.</i> Nay, madam, be not angry at her, we would
come in in spite of her. We are your friends and are as
concerned as you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Ah! madam, madam, madam, madam, I am
an undone woman. Oh me! Alas! Alas! Oh! Oh!
[<i>All join in her notes.</i>] I swoon&mdash;I expire. [<i>Faints.</i></p>

<p><i>2nd La.</i> Pray, Mrs. Tattleaid, bring something that is
cordial to her. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Tattleaid</span>.</p>

<p><i>3rd La.</i> Indeed, madam, you should have patience.
His lordship was old. To die is but going before in a
journey we must all take.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Tattleaid</span> <i>loaded with bottles. 3rd Lady takes a
bottle from her and drinks.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>4th La.</i> Lord, how my Lady Fleer drinks; I've heard,
indeed, but never could believe it of her. [<i>Drinks also.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p><i>1st La.</i> But, madam,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> don't you hear what the town
says of the jilt Flirt the men liked so much in the Park?
Hark ye&mdash;was seen with him in an Hackney-coach&mdash;and
silk stockings&mdash;key-hole&mdash;his wig&mdash;on the chair&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Whispers
by interruptions.</i></p>

<p><i>2nd La.</i> Impudent Flirt, to be found out!</p>

<p><i>3rd La.</i> But I speak it only to you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>4th La.</i> Nor I but to one more&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Whispers
next woman.</i></p>

<p><i>5th La.</i> I can't believe it; nay, I always thought it,
madam&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Whispers the</i> <span class="smcap">Widow</span>.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Sure, 'tis impossible! the demure, prim thing!
Sure all the world's hypocrisy. Well, I thank my stars,
whatsoever sufferings I have, I've none in reputation. I
wonder at the men; I could never think her handsome.
She has really a good shape and complexion, but no
mien; and no woman has the use of her beauty without
mien! Her charms are dumb, they want utterance. But
whither does distraction lead me&mdash;to talk of charms?</p>

<p><i>1st La.</i> Charms? A chit's, a girl's charms. Come,
let us widows be true to ourselves, keep our countenances
and our characters, and a fig for the maids&mdash;I mean for
the unmarried.</p>

<p><i>2nd La.</i> Ay, since they will set up for our knowledge,
why should not we for their ignorance?</p>

<p><i>3rd La.</i> But, madam, on Sunday morning at church I
curtsied to you, and looked at a great fuss in a glaring
light dress next pew. That strong masculine thing is a
knight's wife, pretends to all the tenderness in the world,
and would fain put the unwieldy upon us for the soft, the
languid! She has of a sudden left her dairy, and sets up
for a fine town-lady, calls her maid Sisly her woman,
speaks to her by her surname, Mrs. Cherryfist, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
great foot-boy of nineteen, big enough for a trooper, is
striped into a lace coat, now Mr. Page forsooth.</p>

<p><i>4th La.</i> Oh! I have seen her. Well, I heartily pity
some people for their wealth, they might have been unknown
else! You'd die, madam, to see her and her
equipage. I thought the honest fat tits, her horses, were
ashamed of their finery; they dragged on as if they were
still at the plough, and a great bashful-looked booby
behind grasped the coach as if he held one.</p>

<p><i>5th La.</i> Alas! some people think there's nothing but
being fine to be genteel; but the high prance of the horses,
and the brisk insolence of the servants in an equipage
of quality, are inimitable, but to our own beasts and
servants.</p>

<p><i>1st La.</i> Now you talk of equipage, I envy this lady the
beauty she'll appear in in a mourning coach, 'twill so
become her complexion; I confess I myself mourned two
years for no other reason. Take up that hood there;
Oh! that fair face with a veil. [<i>They take up her hoods.</i></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Fie, fie, ladies. But I've been told, indeed,
black does become&mdash;</p>

<p><i>2nd La.</i> Well, I'll take the liberty to speak it, there's
young Nutbrain has long had (I'll be sworn) a passion
for this lady; but I'll tell you one thing I fear she'll dislike,
that is, he's younger than she is.</p>

<p><i>3rd La.</i> No, that's no exception; but I'll tell you one,
he's younger than his brother.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Ladies, talk not of such affairs. Who could love
such an unhappy relict as I am? But, dear madam, what
grounds have you for that idle story?</p>

<p><i>4th La.</i> Why he toasts you, and trembles when you're
spoke of; it must be a match.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Nay, nay; you rally, you rally; but I know you
mean it kindly.</p>

<p><i>1st La.</i> I swear we do.
[<span class="smcap">Tattleaid</span> <i>whispers the</i> <span class="smcap">Widow</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> But I must beseech you, ladies, since you have
been so compassionate as to visit and accompany my
sorrow, to give me the only comfort I can now know, to
see my friends cheerful, and to honour an entertainment
Tattleaid has prepared within for you. If I can find
strength enough I'll attend you; but I wish you'd excuse
me, for I've no relish of food or joy, but will try to get a
bit down in my own chamber.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> No, no, you must go with us.</p>

<p><i>1st La.</i> There's no pleasure without you.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> But, madam, I must beg of your ladyship not to
be so importune to my fresh calamity, as to mention
Nutbrain any more; I'm sure there's nothing in it. In
love with me, quoth a'. [<i>Is helped off. Exeunt.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mademoiselle</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Campley</span> <i>in women's clothes

<p><i>Mad.</i> I very glad us be in de ladies' antichamber; I
was shamed of you. You, you, such an impudent
look; besides, me wonder you were not seized by the
constable, when you pushed de man into de kennel.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Why, should I have let him kissed me?</p>

<p><i>Mad.</i> No; but if you had hit him wit fan, and say,

<p><i>Cam.</i> I beg pardon, I did not know you were pleased
with it.</p>

<p><i>Mad.</i> Please, no, but me rader be kiss den you,

fie; dese littil pette tiny bits a woman steps.
[<i>Showing her step.</i></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> But prithee, mademoiselle, why have you lost
your English tongue all of a sudden? Methought when
the fellow called us French whores, as we came along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
and said we came to starve their own people, you gave
him pretty plain English; he was a dog, a rascal, you'd
send him to the stocks.</p>

<p><i>Mad.</i> Ha! ha! ha! I was in a passion and betrayed
myself, but you're my lover's friend, and a man of honour,
therefore know you'll do nothing to injure us. Why,
Mr. Campley, you must know I can speak as good English
as you, but I don't for fear of losing my customers. The
English will never give a price for anything they understand.
Nay, I've known some of your fools pretend to
buy with good breeding, and give any rate rather than
not be thought to have French enough to know what
they were doing; strange and far-fetched things they only
like. Don't you see how they swallow gallons of the
juice of tea, while their own dock-leaves are trod under
foot? But mum; my Lady Harriot.</p>

What a delicate chastity she has! There's something so
gross in the carriage of some wives (though they're honest
too) that they lose their husbands' hearts for faults which,
if they had either good nature or good breeding, they
know not how to tell 'em of. But how happy am I in
such a friend as Hardy, such a mistress as Harriot!</p>

<h3>ACT THE FOURTH.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Brumpton's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Widow</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Trusty</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Mr. Trusty, you have, I do
assure you, the same place and
power in the management of my
Lord Brumpton's estate, as in
his life-time. (I am reduced to a
necessity of trusting him) [<i>aside.</i>]
However Tattleaid dissembles
the matter, she must be privy to Lady Harriot's escape,
and Fardingale's as deep with 'em both, and I fear will
be their ruin, which 'tis my care and duty to prevent.
Be vigilant, and you shall be rewarded. I shall employ
you wholly in Lady Sharlot's affairs, she is able to pay
services done for her. You've sense, and understand
me. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Widow</span>.</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> Yes, I do indeed understand you, and could wish
another could with as much detestation as I do, but my
poor old lord is so strangely, so bewitchedly enamoured
of her, that even after this discovery of her wickedness,
I see he could be reconciled to her, and though he is
ashamed to confess to me, I know he longs to speak with
her. If I tell Lord Hardy all to make his fortune, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
would not let his father be dishonoured by a public way
of separation. If things are acted privately, I know she'll
throw us all; there's no middle-way, I must expose her
to make a reunion impracticable. Alas, how is honest
truth banished the world; when we must watch the seasons
and soft avenues to men's hearts, to gain it entrance even
for their own good and interest! [<i>Exit.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Hardy's</span> <i>Lodgings.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Hardy, Campley</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Trim</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> I forget my own misfortunes, dear Campley,
when I reflect on your success.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> I assure you, it moderates the swell of joy that
I am in, to think of your difficulties. I hope my felicity
is previous to yours; my Lady Harriot gives her service
to you, and we both think it but decent to suspend our
marriage 'till your and Lady Sharlot's affairs are in the
same posture.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Where is my lady?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> She's at my aunt's, my lord. But, my lord, if
you don't interpose, I don't know how I shall adjust
matters with Mr. Trim for leaving his mistress behind
me: I fear he'll demand satisfaction of me.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> No, sir, alas, I can know no satisfaction while
she is in jeopardy. Therefore would rather be put in a
way to recover her by storming the castle, or other feat
of arms, like a true enamoured swain as I am.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Since we are all three then expecting lovers, my
lord, prithee let's have that song of yours which suits our
common purpose.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Call in the boy.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ye minutes bring the happy hour,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And Chloe blushing to the bower;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then shall all idle flames be o'er,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor eyes or heart e'er wander more;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Both, Chloe, fixed for e'er on thee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For thou art all thy sex to me.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">II.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A guilty is a false embrace,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Corinna's love's a fairy-chace;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Begone, thou meteor, fleeting fire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And all that can't survive desire.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Chloe my reason moves and awe,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And Cupid shot me when he saw.</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Look you, gentlemen, since as you are pleased
to say we're all lovers, and consequently poets, pray do me
the honour to hear a little air of mine. You must know
then, I once had the misfortune to fall in love below myself,
but things went hard with us at that time, so that
my passion, or as I may poetically speak, my fire was in
the kitchen; 'twas towards a cook-maid, but before I ever
saw Mrs. Deborah.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Come on then, Trim, let's have it.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> I must run into next room for a lute. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> This must be diverting! can the rogue play?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Trim</span>, <i>with a pair of Tongs.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Dear Cynderaxa herself very well understood
this instrument, I therefore always sung this song to it, as
thus&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cynderaxa kind and good,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Has all my heart and stomach too;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">She makes me love, not hate, my food,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">As other peevish wenches do.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">II.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When Venus leaves her Vulcan's cell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Which all but I a coal-hole call;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fly, fly, ye that above stairs dwell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Her face is washed, ye vanish all.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">III.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And as she's fair, she can impart</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That beauty, to make all things fine;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Brightens the floor with wondrous art,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And at her touch the dishes shine.</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> I protest, Will, thou art a poet indeed. "And
at her touch the dishes shine"&mdash;and you touch your
lute as finely.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Boy</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Boy.</i> There's one Mr. Trusty below would speak with
my lord.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Mr. Trusty? My father's steward? What
can he have to say to me?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> He's very honest, to my knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> I remember, indeed, when I was turned out of
the house he followed me to the gate and wept over me,
for which I've heard he'd like to have lost his place. But,
however, I must advise with you a little about my behaviour
to him; let's in. Boy, bring him up hither, tell
him I'll wait on him presently. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Boy</span>.</p>

<p>I shall want you, I believe, here, Trim. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Boy</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Trusty</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Boy.</i> My lord will wait on you here immediately.
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Boy</span>.</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> 'Tis very well, these lodgings are but homely for
the Earl of Brumpton. Oh, that damned strumpet&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
I should ever know my master's wife for such!&mdash;How many
thousand things does my head run back to? After my
poor father's death the good lord took me, because he
was a captain in his regiment, and gave me education.
I was, I think, three-and-twenty when this young lord
within was christened; what a do there was about calling
him Francis! [<i>Wipes his eyes.</i>] These are but poor
lodgings for him. I cannot bear the joy, to think that I
shall save the family from which I've had my bread.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Trim</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Sir, my lord will wait you immediately.</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> Sir, 'tis my duty to wait him&mdash;[<i>As</i> <span class="smcap">Trim</span> <i>is going</i>]
but, sir, are not you the young man that attended him at
Christchurch, in Oxford, and have followed him ever
since?</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Yes, sir, I am.</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> Nay, sir, no harm, but you'll thrive the better
for it.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> I like this old fellow; I smell more money.
[<i>Aside. Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> I think 'tis now eight years since I saw him&mdash;he
was not then nineteen&mdash;when I followed him to the gate,
and gave him fifty guineas, which I pretended his father
sent after him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Hardy</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Mr. Trusty, I'm very glad to see you look
very hale and jolly; you wear well. I'm glad to see it&mdash;but
your commands to me, Mr. Trusty.</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> Why, my lord, I presume to wait on your lordship.
My lord, you're strangely grown; you're your
father's very picture, you're he, my lord; you are the
very man that looked so pleased to see me look so fine in
my laced livery, to go to Court. I was his page when he
was just such another as you. He kissed me afore a great
many lords, and said I was a brave man's son, that taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
him to exercise his arms. I remember he carried
me to the great window, and bid me be sure to keep in
your mother's sight in all my finery. She was the finest
young creature; the maids of honour hated to see her at
Court. My lord then courted my good lady. She was
as kind to me on her death-bed; she said to me, Mr.
Trusty, take care of my lord's second marriage for that
child's sake. She pointed as well as she could to you.
You fell a-crying, and said she should not die; but she
did, my lord. She left the world, and no one like her
in't. Forgive me, my honoured master. [<i>Weeps, runs to
my lord, and hugs him.</i>] I've often carried you in these
arms that grasp you; they were stronger then, but if I die
to-morrow, you're worth five thousand pounds by my
gift&mdash;'tis what I've got in the family, and I return it to
you with thanks. But alas! do I live to see you want
it?<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> You confound me with all this tenderness and
generosity.</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> I'll trouble you no longer, my lord, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Call it not a trouble, for&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> My good lord, I will not, I say, indulge myself
in talking fond tales that melt me, and interrupt my story.
My business to your lordship, in one word, is this: I am
in good confidence at present with my lady dowager,
and I know she has some fears upon her, which depend
upon the nature of the settlement to your disfavour, and
under the rose&mdash;be yourself&mdash;I fear your father has not
had fair play for his life&mdash;be composed, my lord. What
is to be done is this: we'll not apply to public justice in
this case, 'till we see farther; 'twill make it noisy, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
we must not do, if I might advise. You shall, with a detachment
of your Company, seize the corpse as it goes out of
the house this evening to be interred in the country;
'twill only look like taking the administration upon yourself,
and commencing a suit for the estate. She has put
off the lying in state, and Lady Harriot's escape with Mr.
Campley makes her fear he will prove a powerful friend,
both to the young ladies and your lordship. She cannot,
with decency, be so busy, as when the corpse is out of
the house, therefore hastens it. I know your whole
affair; leave the care of Lady Sharlot to me. I'll pre-acquaint
her, that she mayn't be frightened, and dispose
of her safely, to observe the issue.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> I wholly understand you; it shall be done.</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> I'm sure I am wanted this moment for your
interest at home. This ring shall be the passport of
intelligence for whom you send to assault us, and the
remittance of it sealed with this, shall be authentic from
within the house.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> 'Tis very well.</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> Hope all you can wish, my lord, from a certain
secret relating to the estate, which I'll acquaint you with
next time I see you. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Your servant&mdash;&mdash;This fellow's strangely
honest&mdash;&mdash;Ha! Will.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Campley</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Trim</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Will! don't the recruits wait for me to see 'em at their
parade before this house?</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Yes; and have waited these three hours.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Go to 'em; I'll be there myself immediately.
We must attack with 'em, if the rogues are sturdy, this
very evening.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> I guess where&mdash;&mdash;I'm overjoyed at it. I'll
warrant you they do it, if I command in chief.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> I design you shall. [<span class="smcap">Trim</span> <i>runs out jumping.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> You seem, my lord, to be in deep meditation.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> I am so, but not on anything that you may
not be acquainted with. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<i>Covent Garden.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Trim</span>, <i>with a company of ragged fellows,
with a cane.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>1st Sol.</i> Why then, I find, Mr. Trim, we shall come to
blows before we see the French.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Harkee, friend, 'tis not your affair to guess or
enquire what you're going to do; 'tis only for us commanders.</p>

<p><i>2nd Sol.</i> The French? Pox! they are but a Company
of scratching civet cats. They fight!</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Harkee, don't bluster. Were not you a little
mistaken in your facings at Steinkirk?</p>

<p><i>2nd Sol.</i> I grant it; you know I have an antipathy to
the French&mdash;I hate to see the dogs. Look you here,
gentlemen, I was shot quite through the body, look
you.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Prithee, look where it entered at your back.</p>

<p><i>2nd Sol.</i> Look you, Mr. Trim, you will have your joke,
we know you are a wit&mdash;but what's that to a fighting
man?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Kate</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Mr. Trim! Mr. Trim!</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Things are not as they have been, Mrs. Kate.
I now pay the Company, and we that pay money expect
a little more ceremony.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Will your honour please to taste some right
French brandy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Art thou sure, good woman, 'tis right? [<i>Drinks.</i>
How&mdash;French&mdash;pray&mdash;nay, if I find you deceive me,
who pay the men&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Drinks.</i></p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Pray, good master, have you spoken to my lord
about me?</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> I have, but you shall speak to him yourself.
Thou hast been a true campaigner, Kate, and we must
not neglect thee. Do you sell grey pease yet of an
evening, Mrs. Matchlock? [<i>Drinks again.</i></p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Anything to turn the penny, but I got more by
crying pamphlets this year, than by anything I have done
a great while. Now I am married into the Company
again, I design to cross the seas next year. But, master,
my husband, a Temple porter, and a Parliament man's
footman, last night by their talk made me think there
was danger of a peace; why, they said, all the prime
people were against a war.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> No, no, Kate, never fear; you know I keep
great company. All men are for a war, but some would
have it abroad, and some would have it at home in their
own country.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Ay, say you so? Drink about, gentlemen, not a
farthing to pay; a war is a war, be it where it will. But
pray, Mr. Trim, speak to my lord, that when these gentlemen
have shirts I may wash for 'em.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> I tell you, if you behave well to-night, you shall
have a fortnight's pay each man as a reward; but there's
none of you industrious. There's a thousand things you
might do to help out about this town, as to cry, puff,
puff pies&mdash;have you any knives or scissors to grind? or,
late in an evening, whip from Grub Street, strange and
bloody news from Flanders&mdash;votes from the House of
Commons&mdash;buns, rare buns&mdash;old silver lace, cloaks, suits,
or coats&mdash;old shoes, boots, or hats&mdash;But here, here, here's
my lord a-coming; here's the captain. Fall back into
the rank there; move up in the centre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Hardy</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Campley</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Let me see whether my ragged friends are
ready and about me.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Ensign Campley, Ensign Campley, I am overjoyed
to see your honour; ha! the world's surely
altered, ha!</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> 'Tis so, faith! Kate, why thou art true to the
cause, with the Company still, honest amazon.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Dear soul, not a bit of pride in him; but won't
your honour help in my business with my lord? Speak
for me, noble ensign, do.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Speak to him yourself; I'll second you.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> Noble captain, my lord! I suppose Mr. Trim
has told your honour about my petition. I have been a
great sufferer in the service. 'Tis hard for a poor woman
to lose nine husbands in a war, and no notice taken;
nay, three of 'em, alas, in the same campaign. Here the
woman stands that says it. I never stripped a man 'till
I first tried if he could stand on his legs, and, if not, I
think 'twas fair plunder, except our adjutant, and he was
a puppy, that made my eighth husband run the gauntlet
for not turning his toes out.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Well, we'll consider thee, Kate, but fall
back into the rear. A roll of what? Gentlemen soldiers?</p>

<p><i>Trim</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Pumkin</span>]. Do you hear that? My lord himself
can't deny but we are all gentlemen, as much as his
honour.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> [<i>Reading</i>]. Gentlemen soldiers quartered in and
about Guy Court in Vinegar Yard, in Russel Court in
Drury Lane, belonging to the honourable Captain Hardy's
Company of Foot&mdash;So, answer to your names, and march
off from the left. John Horseem, corporal, march easy,
that I may view you as you pass by me. Drums
Simon Ruffle, Darby Tattoo&mdash;there's a shilling for you&mdash;Tattoo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
be always so tight; how does he keep himself
so clean?</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Sir, he is a tragedy drum to one of the playhouses.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Private gentlemen: Alexander Cowitch,
Humphrey Mundungus, William Faggot, Nicholas Scab,
Timothy Megrim, Philip Scratch, Nehemiah Dust, Humphrey
Garbage, Nathaniel Matchlock.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> What! Is Matchlock come back to the Company?
That's the fellow that brought me off at Steinkirk.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> No, sir, 'tis I am obliged to him for that.
[<i>Offering to give him money.</i>] There, friend, you shall
want for nothing; I'll give thee a halbert too.</p>

<p><i>Kate.</i> O brave me! Shall I be a sergeant's lady?
I' faith, I'll make the drums, and the corporal's wives, and
Company-keepers know their distance.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> How far out of the country did you come to
list? Don't you come from Cornwall? How did you bear
your charges?</p>

<p><i>Match.</i> I was whipped from constable to constable&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Ay, my lord, that's due by the courtesy of
England to all that want in red coats; besides, there's
an Act that makes us free of all corporations, and that's
the ceremony of it.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> But what pretence had they for using you so ill?
You did not pilfer?</p>

<p><i>Match.</i> I was found guilty of being poor.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Poor devil!</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Timothy Ragg! O Ragg! I thought when
I gave you your discharge, just afore the peace, we
should never have had you again. How came you to
list now?</p>

<p><i>Ragg.</i> To pull down the French king.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Bravely resolved! But pull your shirt into
your breeches in the mean time. Jeoffrey Tatter&mdash;What's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
become of the skirts and buttons of your
coat?</p>

<p><i>Tatter.</i> In our last clothing in the regiment I served
in afore, the colonel had one skirt before, the agent one
behind, and every captain of the regiment a button.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Hush, you rogue, you talk mutiny. [<i>Smiling.</i></p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Ay, sirrah, what have you to do with more
knowledge than that of your right hand from your left?
[<i>Hits him a blow on the head.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Hugh Clump&mdash;Clump, thou growest a little
too heavy for marching.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Ay, my lord, but if we don't allow him the
pay he'll starve, for he's too lame to get into the hospital.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Richard Bumpkin! Ha! A perfect country
hick. How came you, friend, to be a soldier?</p>

<p><i>Bump.</i> An't please your honour, I have been crossed
in love, and am willing to seek my fortune.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Well, I've seen enough of 'em. If you mind
your affair, and act like a wise general, these fellows may
do&mdash;come, take your orders. [<span class="smcap">Trim</span> <i>puts his hat on his
stick, while my lord is giving him the ring, and whispers

and nothing shall be too good for you.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Bless your honour. [<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Hardy</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Campley</span>.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Now, my brave friends and fellow-soldiers&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
I must fellow-soldier 'em just afore a battle, like
a true officer, though I cane 'em all the year round beside&mdash;[<i>Strutting
about.</i>] Major-General Trim; no, pox, Trim
sounds so very short and priggish&mdash;that my name should
be a monosyllable! But the foreign news will write me, I
suppose, Monsieur or Chevalier Trimont. Seigneur
Trimoni, or Count Trimuntz, in the German Army, I shall
perhaps be called; ay, that's all the plague and comfort
of us great men, they do so toss our names about. But,
gentlemen, you are now under my command&mdash;huzza!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
thrice&mdash;faith, this is very pleasing, this grandeur! Why,
after all, 'tis upon the neck of such scoundrels as these
gentlemen that we great captains build our renown. A
million or two of these fellows make an Alexander, and
as that my predecessor said in the tragedy of him on the
very same occasion, going to storm for his Statira, so do
I for my dear seamstress, Madam d'Epingle&mdash;</p>

<h3>ACT THE FIFTH.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Brumpton's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Trusty</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Brumpton</span>.</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> She knows no moderation in her
good fortune; she has, out of impatience
to see herself in her weeds,
ordered her mantua woman to stitch
up anything immediately. You may
hear her and Tattleaid laugh aloud&mdash;she
is so wantonly merry.</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> But this of Lady Sharlot is the very utmost of
all ill. Pray read&mdash;but I must sit; my late fit of the
gout makes me act with pain and constraint. Let me
see&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> She writ it by the page, who brought it me, as I
had wheedled him to do all their passages.</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> [<i>Reads.</i>]</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You must watch the occasion of the servants being
gone out of the house with the corpse; Tattleaid shall
conduct you to my Lady Sharlot's apartment&mdash;away with
her&mdash;and be sure you bed her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your affectionate Sister,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mary Brumpton</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Brumpton? The creature! She called as Frank's
mother was? Brumpton! The succuba! What a devil
incarnate have I had in my bosom? Why, the common
abandoned town women would scruple such an action as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
this. Though they have lost all regard to their own
chastity, they would be tender of another's. Why, sure
she had no infancy. She never had virginity, to have no
compassion through memory of her own former innocence.
This is to forget her very humanity&mdash;her very
sex. Where is my poor boy? Where's Frank? Does
not he want? How has he lived all this time? Not a
servant, I warrant, to attend him&mdash;what company can he
keep? What can he say of his father?</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> Though you made him not your heir, he is still
your son, and has all the duty and tenderness in the
world for your memory.</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> It is impossible, Trusty; it is impossible. I
will not rack myself with the thought, that one I have
injured can be so very good&mdash;keep me in countenance&mdash;tell
me he hates my very name, would not assume my
title because it descends from me. What's his company?</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> Young Tom Campley; they are never asunder.</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> I am glad he has my pretty tattler&mdash;the cheerful
innocent Harriot. I hope he'll be good to her; he's
good-natured and well-bred.</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> But, my lord, she was very punctual in ordering
the funeral. She bid Sable be sure to lay you deep
enough, she had heard such stories of the wicked sextons
taking up people; but I wish, my lord, you would please
to hear her and Tattleaid once more&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> I know to what thy zeal tends; but I tell you,
since you cannot be convinced but that I have still
a softness for her&mdash;I say though I had so, it should never
make me transgress that scrupulous honour that becomes
a peer of England. If I could forget injuries done myself
thus gross, I never will those done my friends. You
knew Sharlot's worthy father&mdash;No, there's no need of
my seeing more of this woman. I behold her now
with the same eyes that you do; there's a meanness
in all she says or does; she has a great wit but a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
mind&mdash;something ever wanting to make her appear my
Lady Brumpton. She has nothing natively great. You
see I love her not; I talk with judgment of her.</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> I see it, my good lord, with joy I see it, nor care
how few things I see more in this world. My satisfaction

decay, but growth to a latter being.

<p><i>Tru.</i> I have your letter, Mr. Cabinet.</p>

<p><i>Cab.</i> I hope, sir, you'll believe it was not in my nature
to be guilty of so much baseness; but being born a gentleman,
and bred out of all roads of industry in that idle
manner too many are, I soon spent a small patrimony;
and being debauched by luxury, I fell into the narrow
mind to dread no infamy like poverty, which made me
guilty, as that paper tells you; and had I not writ to you,
I am sure I never could have told you of it.</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> It is an ingenious, pious penitence in you; my
Lord Hardy (to whom this secret is inestimable) is a
noble-natured man, and you shall find him such, I give
you my word.</p>

<p><i>Cab.</i> I know, sir, your integrity.</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> But pray be there; all that you have to do is to
ask for the gentlewoman at the house at my Lord Hardy's;
she'll take care of you. And pray have patience, where
she places you, till you see me. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Cab.</span>] My Lord
Hardy's being a house where they receive lodgers, has
allowed me convenience to place everybody I think necessary
to be by at her discovery. This prodigious welcome
secret! I see, however impracticable honest actions may
appear, we may go on with just hope&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All that is ours is to be justly bent,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And Heaven in its own cause will bless the event.</span><br />

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>Covent Garden.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Trim</span> <i>and his party.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Trim.</i> March up, march up. Now we are near the
citadel, and halt only to give the necessary orders for the
engagement. Ha! Clump, Clump! When we come to
Lord Brumpton's door, and you see us conveniently disposed
about the house, you are to wait till you see a
corpse brought out of the house; then to go up to him
you observe the director, and ask importunately for an
alms to a poor soldier, for which you may be sure you
shall have a good blow or two; but if you have not, be
saucy till you have. Then when you see a file of men
got between the house and the body&mdash;a file of men,
Bumpkin, is six men&mdash;I say, when you see the file in
such a posture, that half the file may face to the house,
half to the body, you are to fall down, crying murder,
that the half file faced to the body may throw it and
themselves over you. I then march to your rescue.
Then, Swagger, you and your party fall in to secure my
rear, while I march off with the body. These are the
orders; and this, with a little improvement of my own,
is the same disposition Villeroy and Catinat made at
Chiari. [<i>Marches off with his party.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Brumpton's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> Widow, <i>in deep mourning, with a dead squirrel on
her arm, and</i> <span class="smcap">Tattleaid</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Wid.</i> It must be so; it must be your carelessness.
What had the page to do in my bedchamber?</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> Indeed, madam, I can't tell. But I came in and
catched him wringing round his neck&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Tell the rascal from me he shall romp with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
footmen no more. No; I'll send the rogue in a frock to
learn Latin among the dirty boys that come to good, I
will. But 'tis ever so among these creatures that live on
one's superfluous affections; a lady's woman, page, and
squirrel are always rivals.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Poor harmless animal&mdash;pretty e'en in death:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Death might have overlooked thy little life&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">How could'st thou, Robin, leave thy nuts and me?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">How was't importunate, dearest, thou should'st die?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thou never did'st invade thy neighbour's soils;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Never mad'st war with specious shows of peace;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thou never hast depopulated regions,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But cheerfully did'st bear thy little chain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Content&mdash;so I but fed thee with this hand.</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> Alas, alas! we are all mortal. Consider, madam,
my lord's dead too. [<i>Weeps.</i></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Ay, but our animal friends do wholly die; an
husband or relation, after death, is rewarded or tormented;
that's some consolation&mdash;I know her tears are
false, for she hated Robin always; but she's a well-bred,
dishonest servant, that never speaks a painful truth.
[<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;But I'll resolve to conquer my affliction&mdash;never
speak more of Robin&mdash;hide him there. But to my dress:
How soberly magnificent is black&mdash;and the train&mdash;I
wonder how widows came to wear such long tails?</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> Why, madam, the stateliest of all creatures has
the longest tail; the peacock, nay, 't has of all creatures
the finest mien too&mdash;except your ladyship, who are a
Phœnix&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Ho! brave Tattleaid! But did not you observe
what a whining my Lady Sly made when she had drank
a little? Did you believe her? Do you think there are
really people sorry for their husbands?</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> Really, madam, some men do leave their fortunes
in such distraction that I believe it may be&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Speaks
with pins in her mouth.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> But I swear I wonder how it came up to dress
us thus. I protest, when all my equipage is ready, and
I move in full pageantry, I shall fancy myself an embassadress
from the Commonwealth of Women, the distressed
State of Amazonia&mdash;to treat for men. But I protest I
wonder how two of us thus clad can meet with a grave
face! Methinks they should laugh out like two fortune-tellers,
or two opponent lawyers that know each other
for cheats&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> Ha! ha! ha! I swear to you, madam, your
ladyship's wit will choke me one time or other. I had
like to have swallowed all the pins in my mouth&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> But, Tatty, to keep house six weeks, that's another
barbarous custom; but the reason of it, I suppose, was
that the base people should not see people of quality may
be as afflicted as themselves.</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> No, 'tis because they should not see 'em as merry
as themselves.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Ha! ha! ha! Hussy, you never said that you
spoke last. Why, 'tis just&mdash;'tis satire&mdash;I'm sure you saw
it in my face, that I was going to say it: 'Twas too good
for you. Come, lay down that sentence and the pin-cushion,
and pin up my shoulder. Harkee, hussy, if
you should, as I hope you won't, outlive me, take care
I ain't buried in flannel; 'twould never become me, I'm
sure.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> That they can be as merry: Well, I'll tell my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
new acquaintance&mdash;what's her name?&mdash;she that reads
so much, and writes verses. Her husband was deaf the
first quarter of a year; I forget her name. That
expression she'll like. Well, that woman does divert me
strangely; I'll be very great with her. She talked very
learnedly of the ridicule till she was ridiculous; then she
spoke of the decent, of the agreeable, of the insensible.
She designs to print the discourse; but of all things, I
like her notion of the insensible.</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> Pray, madam, how was that?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> A most useful discourse to be inculcated in our
teens. The purpose of it is to disguise our apprehension
in this ill-bred generation of men, who speak before
women what they ought not to hear. As now, suppose
you were a spark in my company, and you spoke some
double entendre, I look thus! But be a fellow, and you
shall see how I'll use you. The insensible is useful upon
any occasion where we seemingly neglect and secretly
approve, which is our ordinary common case. Now,
suppose a coxcomb, dancing, prating, and playing his
tricks before me to move me, without pleasure or distaste
in my countenance, I look at him, just thus; but&mdash;&mdash;Ha!
ha! ha! I have found out a supplement to this
notion of the insensible, for my own use, which is infallible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and that is to have always in my head all that they can
say or do to me. So never be surprised with laughter,
the occasion of which is always sudden.</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> Oh! my Lady Brumpton [<span class="smcap">Tattleaid</span> <i>bows and
cringes</i>], my lady, your most obedient servant.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Look you, wench, you see by the art of insensibility
I put you out of countenance, though you were
prepared for an ill-reception.</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> Oh! madam, how justly are you formed for what
is now fallen to you&mdash;the empire of mankind.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Oh! sir, that puts me out of all my insensibility
at once; that was so gallant&mdash;Ha! what noise is that;
that noise of fighting? Run, I say. Whither are you
going? What, are you mad? Will you leave me alone?
Can't you stir? What, you can't take your message with
you? Whatever 'tis, I suppose you are not in the plot;
not you&mdash;Nor that now they're breaking open my house
for Sharlot&mdash;Not you&mdash;Go, see what's the matter, I say,
I have nobody I can trust. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Tattleaid</span>] One
minute I think this wench honest, and the next false.
Whither shall I turn me?</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> Madam, madam. [<i>Re-entering.</i></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Madam, madam, will you swallow me gaping?</p>

<p><i>Tat.</i> Pray, good my lady, be not so out of humour;
but there is a company of rogues have set upon our
servants and the burial man's, while others ran away with
the corpse.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> How, what can this mean? What can they do
with it?&mdash;Well, 'twill save the charge of interment&mdash;But
to what end?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Trusty</span> <i>and a</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>, <i>bloody and dirty, haling in</i>

<p><i>Ser.</i> I'll teach you better manners; I'll poor soldier
you, you dog you, I will. Madam, here are two of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
rascals that were in the gang of rogues that carried away
the corpse.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> We'll examine 'em apart. Well, sirrah, what are
you? Whence came you? What's your name, sirrah?
[<span class="smcap">Clump</span> <i>makes signs as a dumb man.</i></p>

<p><i>Ser.</i> Oh, you dog, you could speak loud enough just
now, sirrah, when your brother rogues mauled Mr. Sable.
We'll make you speak, sirrah.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Bring the other fellow hither. I suppose you
will own you knew that man before you saw him at my
door?</p>

<p><i>Clump.</i> I think I have seen the gentleman's face.
[<i>Bowing to</i> <span class="smcap">Bumpkin</span>.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> The gentleman's! The villain mocks me. But
friend, you look like an honest man&mdash;what are you?
Whence came you? What are you, friend?</p>

<p><i>Bump.</i> I'se at present but a private gentleman, but I
was lifted to be a sergeant in my Lord Hardy's Company.
I'se not ashamed of my name nor of my koptin.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Leave the room all. [<i>Exeunt all but</i> <span class="smcap">Trusty</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Tattleaid</span>.] Mr. Trusty&mdash;Lord Hardy! O, that
impious young man, thus, with the sacrilegious hands of
ruffians to divert his father's ashes from their urn and
rest&mdash;I suspect this fellow [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Mr. Trusty, I must
desire you to be still near me. I'll know the bottom of
this; and to Lord Hardy's lodgings as I am, instantly.
'Tis but the back side of this street, I think. Let a
coach be called.&mdash;Tattleaid, as soon as I am gone, conduct
my brother and his friends to Lady Sharlot. Away
with her. Bring mademoiselle away to me, that she may
not be a witness.&mdash;Come, good Mr. Trusty.</p>

<h4>SCENE IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Hardy's</span> <i>Lodgings.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Hardy</span>, <i>leading</i> <span class="smcap">Harriot; Campley</span>, <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Trim</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> Why, then I find this Mr. Trim is a perfect
general; but I assure you, sir, I'll never allow you an
hero, who could leave your mistress behind you. You
should have broke the house down, but you should have
mademoiselle with you.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> No, really, madam, I have seen such strange fears
come into the men's heads, and such strange resolutions
into the women's upon the occasion of ladies following a
camp, that I thought it more discreet to leave her behind
me. My success will naturally touch her as much as if
she were here.</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> A good, intelligent, arch fellow this [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;But
were not you saying, my lord, you believed Lady
Brumpton would follow hither? If so, pray let me
be gone.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> No, madam, I must beseech your ladyship to
stay, for there are things alleged against her which
you, who have lived in the family, may perhaps give light
into, and which I can't believe even she could be guilty
of.</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> Nay, my lord, that's generous to a folly, for
even for her usage of you (without regard to myself), I
am ready to believe she would do anything that can
come into the head of a close, malicious, cruel, designing
woman.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Boy</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Boy.</i> My Lady Brumpton's below.</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> I'll run, then.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> No, no, stand your ground. You, a soldier's
wife? Come, we'll rally her to death.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Prithee, entertain her a little, while I go in for
a moment's thought on this occasion. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> She has more wit than us both.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Pshaw, no matter for that; be sure, as soon as
the sentence is out of my mouth, to clap in with something
else; and laugh at all I say. I'll be grateful, and
burst myself at my pretty, witty wife. We'll fall in slap
upon her; she shan't have time to say a word of the
running away.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Brumpton</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Trusty</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh, my Lady Brumpton, your ladyship's most obedient
servant: This is my Lady Harriot Campley. Why,
madam, your ladyship is immediately in your mourning.
Nay, as you have more wit than anybody, so (what
seldom wits have) you have more prudence, too. Other
widows have nothing in a readiness but a second husband;
but you, I see, had your very weeds and dress
lying by you.</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> Ay, madam; I see your ladyship is of the
Order of Widowhood, for you have put on the habit.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> I see your ladyship is not of the profession of
virginity, for you have lost the look on't.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> You are in the habit&mdash;That was so pretty; nay,
without flattery, Lady Harriot, you have a great deal of
wit. Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> No, my Lady Brumpton here is the woman of
wit; but, indeed, she has but little enough, considering
how much her ladyship has to defend. Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> I am sorry, madam, your ladyship has not what's
sufficient for your occasions, or that this pretty gentleman
can't supply 'em&mdash;&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Campley</span>
<i>dancing about and trolling.</i>
Hey, day! I find, sir, your heels are a great help to your
head. They relieve your wit, I see; and I don't question
but ere now they have been as kind to your valour.
Ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Pox, I can say nothing; 'tis always thus with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
your endeavours to be witty [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;I saw, madam,
your mouth go, but there could be nothing offered in
answer to what my Lady Harriot said.&mdash;'Twas home&mdash;'Twas
cutting satire.</p>

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> Oh, Mr. Campley! But pray, madam, has
Mr. Cabinet visited your ladyship since this calamity?
How stands that affair now?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Nay, madam, if you already want instructions,
I'll acquaint you how the world stands, if you are in
distress&mdash;but I fear Mr. Campley overhears us.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> And all the tune the pipers played was Toll-toll-doroll.
I swear, Lady Harriot, were I not already
yours, I could have a tender for this lady.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Come, good folks, I find we are very free with
each other. What makes you two here? Do you board
my lord, or he you? Come, come, ten shillings a head
will go a great way in a family. What do you say, Mrs.
Campley, is it so? Does your ladyship go to market
yourself? Nay, you're in the right of it. Come, can
you imagine what makes my lord stay? He is not now
with his land-steward. Not signing leases, I hope?
Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Hang her, to have more tongue than a man and
his wife too. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Hardy</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Because your ladyship is, I know, in very
much pain in company you have injured, I'll be short&mdash;Open
those doors&mdash;There lies your husband's, my
father's body; and by you stands the man accuses you of
poisoning him.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Of poisoning him!</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> The symptoms will appear upon the corpse.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> But I am seized by nature&mdash;How shall I view,
a breathless lump of clay, him whose high veins conveyed
to me this vital force and motion?<br /><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>

Gorgeous attire, or studied negligence,<br />
Or song, or dance, or ball, allure thy soul;<br />
Nor want, or fear, such arts to keep or lose it:<br />

<p><i>L. Ha.</i> Ay, marry, these are high doings indeed; the
greatness of the occasion has burst their passion into
speech. Why, Mr Campley, when we are near these
fine folks, you and I are but mere sweethearts. I
protest I'll never be won so; you shall begin again
with me.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Prithee, why dost name us poor animals? They
have forgot there are such creatures as their old acquaintance
Tom and Harriot.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> So we did indeed, but you'll pardon us.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Sir, you're at the bottom of all this; I see you're
skilled at close conveyances. I'll know the meaning
instantly of these intricacies. 'Tis not your seeming
honesty and gravity shall save you from your deserts.
My husband's death was sudden. You and the burial
fellow were observed very familiar. Produce my husband's
body, or I'll try you for his murder; which I find
you'd put on me, thou hellish engine!</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> Look you, madam, I could answer you, but I
scorn to reproach people in misery. You're undone,
madam.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> What does the dotard mean? Produce the
body, villain, or the law shall have thine for it. [<span class="smcap">Trusty</span>
<i>exit hastily.</i>]&mdash;Do you design to let the villain escape?
How justly did your father judge, that made you a
beggar with that spirit! You meant just now you could
not bear the company of those you'd injured.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> You are a woman, madam, and my father's
widow. But sure you think you've highly injured me.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> No, sir, I have not, will not, injure you. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
must obey the will of my deceased lord to a tittle; I must
justly pay legacies. Your father, in consideration that
you were his blood, would not wholly alienate you. He
left you, sir, this shilling, with which estate you now are
Earl of Brumpton.</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> Insolent woman! it was not me my good
father disinherited; 'twas him you represented. The
guilt was thine; he did an act of justice.</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> [<i>Turning from her, running to his son.</i>] Oh,
my boy, my son. Mr. Campley, Sharlot, Harriot! [<i>All

are too strong for my old frame. Oh, the sweet torture!
my son! my son! I shall expire in the too mighty
pleasure! my boy!</p>

<p><i>Ld. H.</i> A son, an heir, a bridegroom in one hour!
Oh! grant me, Heaven, grant me moderation!</p>

<p>

What? can my lord revive, yet dead to me?<br />
Only to me deceased&mdash;to me alone,<br />
Deaf to my sighs, and senseless to my moan?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> 'Tis so long since I have seen plays, good
madam, that I know not whence thou dost repeat, nor
can I answer.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> You can remember, though, a certain settlement,
in which I am thy son and heir. Great noble, that's I
suppose not taken from a play? That's as irrevocable as
law can make it, that if you scorn me, your death and
life are equal; or I'll still wear my mourning 'cause
you're living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> Value her not, my lord; a prior obligation made
you incapable of settling on her, your wife.</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> Thy kindness, Trusty, does distract thee. I
would indeed disengage myself by any honest means,
but, alas, I know no prior gift that avoids this to her&mdash;Oh,

<p><i>Tru.</i> Hold, sir, you must not stir, nor can you, sir,
retract this for your hand-writing.&mdash;My lord, this gentleman,
since your supposed death, has lurked about the
house to speak with my lady, or Tattleaid, who upon your
decease have shunned him, in hopes, I suppose, to
buy him off for ever. Now, as he was prying about,
he peeped into your closet, where he saw your lordship
reading. Struck with horror, and believing himself
(as well he might) the disturber of your ghost for
alienation of your fortune from your family, he writ me
this letter, wherein he acknowledges a private marriage
with this lady, half a year before you ever saw her.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> How? [<i>All turn upon her disdainfully.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Wid.</i> No more a widow then, but still a wife.<br />
[<i>Recovering from her confusion.</i><br />
I am thy wife&mdash;thou author of my evil<br />
Thou must partake with me an homely board,<br />
An homely board that never shall be cheerful;<br />
But every meal embittered with upbraidings.<br />
Thou that could'st tell me, good and ill were words,<br />
When thou could'st basely let me to another,<br />
Yet could'st see sprights, great unbeliever!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>Coward! Bug-beared penitent&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Stranger henceforth to all my joys, my joys<br />
To thy dishonour; despicable thing,<br />
Dishonour thee? Thou voluntary cuckold.<br />
[<span class="smcap">Cabinet</span> <i>sneaks off,</i> <span class="smcap">Widow</span> <i>flings after him,</i>
<span class="smcap">Tattleaid</span> <i>following.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> I see you're all confused as well as I. Ye
are my children, I hold you all so; and for your own
use will speak plainly to you. I cannot hate that woman;
nor shall she ever want. Though I scorn to bear her
injuries, yet had I ne'er been roused from that low passion
to a worthless creature, but by disdain of her attempt
on my friend's child. I am glad that scorn's confirmed
by her being that fellow's, whom, for my own sake, I only
will contemn. Thee, Trusty, how shall we prosecute
with equal praise and thanks for this great revolution in
our house?</p>

<p><i>Tru.</i> Never to speak on't more, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Ld. B.</i> You are now, gentlemen, going into cares at a
crisis<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> in your country.<br />
And on this great occasion, Tom, I'll mount<br />
Old Campley which thy father gave me,<br />
And attend thee a cheerful gay old man,<br />
Into the field to represent our county.<br />
My rough plebeian Britons, not yet slaves<br />
To France, shall mount thy father's son<br />
Upon their shoulders. Echo loud their joy,<br />
While I and Trusty follow weeping after:<br />
But be thou honest, firm, impartial,<br />
Let neither love, nor hate, nor faction move thee,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a><br />
Distinguish words from things, and men from crimes;<br /><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Punctual be thou in payments, nor basely<br />
Screen thy faults 'gainst law, behind the<br />
Laws thou makest<br />
But thou against my death, must learn a supererogatory morality.<br />
[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Hardy</span>.<br />
As he is to be just, be generous thou:<br />
Nor let thy reasonable soul be struck<br />
With sounds and appellations; title is<br />
No more, if not significant<br />
Of something that's superior in thyself<br />
To other men, of which thou may'st be<br />
Conscious, yet not proud&mdash;But if you swerve<br />
From higher virtue than the crowd possess,<br />
Know, they that call thee honourable mock thee.<br />
You are to be a Peer, by birth a judge<br />
Upon your honour, of others' lives and fortunes;<br />
Because that honour's dearer than your own.<br />
Be good, my son, and be a worthy lord<br />
For when our shining virtues bless mankind,<br />
We disappoint the livid malcontents,<br />
Who long to call our noble Order useless.<br />
Our all's in danger, sir, nor shall you dally<br />
Your youth away with your fine wives.<br />
No, in your country's cause you shall meet death,<br />
While feeble we with minds resigned do wait it.<br />
Not but I intend your nuptials as soon as possible, to
draw entails and settlements. How necessary such things
are, I had like to have been a fatal instance.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> But, my lord, here are a couple that need not
wait such ceremonies. Please but to sit; you've been
extremely moved, and must be tired. You say we must
not spend our time in dalliance; you'll see, my lord, the
entertainment reminds us also of nobler things, and what
I designed for my own wedding I'll compliment the
general with. The bride dances finely. Trim, will you
dance with her?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> I will, but I can't. There's a countryman of
hers without, by accident.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Ay, but is he a dancer?</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Is a Frenchman a dancer? Is a Welshman a
gentleman? I'll bring him in.</p>

<p><i>The Lying Lover: or the Ladies' Friendship</i>,
a Comedy, was acted at Drury
Lane Theatre on December 2, 1703,
and ran for six nights. It was published
by Bernard Lintot on January
26, 1704. Wilks (Bookwit, jun.),
Mills (Lovemore), Cibber (Latine),
Pinkethman (Storm), and Bullock (Charcoal), together
with Mrs. Oldfield (Victoria), and Mrs. Rogers (Penelope),
acted in this piece, which, so far as is known, has
been revived only once (April 4, 1746) since it was
originally produced. The plot was taken from <i>Le
Menteur</i>, by Corneille, who had borrowed from Ruiz
de Alarcon's <i>Verdad Sospechosa</i>. Steele is, of course,
solely responsible for the scenes in Newgate towards the
end of the piece. Samuel Foote afterwards made much
use of Steele's play in his <i>Liar</i>.</p>

<h4><i>To His Grace the</i></h4>

<h3>DUKE OF ORMOND.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>Out of gratitude to the memorable and
illustrious patron of my infancy,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
your Grace's grandfather, I presume
to lay this Comedy at your feet.
The design of it is to banish out of
conversation all entertainment which
does not proceed from simplicity of
mind, good-nature, friendship, and honour. Such a purpose
will not, I hope, be unacceptable to so great a lover
of mankind as your Grace; and if your patronage can
recommend it to all who love and honour the Duke of
Ormond, its reception will be as extensive as the world
itself.</p>

<p>'Twas the irresistible force of this humanity in your
temper that has carried you through the various successes
of war, with the peculiar and undisputed distinction that
you have drawn your sword without other motive than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
passionate regard for the glory of your country; since
before you entered into its service, you were possessed
of its highest honours, but could not be contented with
the illustrious rank your birth gave you, without repeating
the glorious actions by which it was acquired.</p>

<p>But there cannot be less expected from the son of an
Ossory, than to contemn life, to adorn it, and with
munificence, affability, scorn of gain, and passion for
glory, to be the honour and example to the profession of
arms; all which engaging qualities your noble family has
exerted with so steadfast a loyalty, that in the most
adverse fortune of our monarchy, popularity, which in
others had been invidious, was a security to the Crown,
when lodged in the House of Ormond.</p>

<p>Thus your Grace entered into the business of the
world with so great an expectation, that it seemed impossible
there could be anything left which might still
conduce to the honour of your name. But the most
memorable advantage your country has gained this
century was obtained under your command; and Providence
thought fit to give the wealth of the Indies into
his hands, who only could despise it; while, with a
superior generosity, he knows no reward but in opportunities
of bestowing. The great personage whom you
succeed in your honours, made me feel, before I was
sensible of the benefit, that this glorious bent of mind is
hereditary to you. I hope, therefore, you will pardon
me, that I take the liberty of expressing my veneration
for his remains, by assuring your Grace that I am,</p>

<p>My Lord,</p>

<p>Your Grace's most obedient</p>

<p>And most devoted</p>

<p>Humble Servant,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard Steele</span>.</p>

<h3>THE PREFACE.</h3>


<p>Though it ought to be the care of all
Governments that public representations
should have nothing in them
but what is agreeable to the manners,
laws, religion, and policy of the place
or nation in which they are exhibited;
yet is it the general complaint of the
more learned and virtuous amongst us, that the English
stage has extremely offended in this kind. I thought,
therefore, it would be an honest ambition to attempt a
Comedy which might be no improper entertainment in a
Christian commonwealth.</p>

<p>In order to this, the spark of this play is introduced
with as much agility and life as he brought with him from
France, and as much humour as I could bestow upon
him in England. But he uses the advantages of a
learned education, a ready fancy, and a liberal fortune,
without the circumspection and good sense which should
always attend the pleasures of a gentleman; that is to
say, a reasonable creature.</p>

<p>Thus he makes false love, gets drunk, and kills his
man; but in the fifth Act awakes from his debauch, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the compunction and remorse which is suitable to a
man's finding himself in a gaol for the death of his
friend, without his knowing why.</p>

<p>The anguish he there expresses, and the mutual sorrow
between an only child and a tender father in that distress,
are, perhaps, an injury to the rules of comedy, but
I am sure they are a justice to those of morality. And
passages of such a nature being so frequently applauded
on the stage, it is high time that we should no longer
draw occasions of mirth from those images which the
religion of our country tells us we ought to tremble at
with horror.</p>

<p>But her Most Excellent Majesty has taken the stage
into her consideration;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and we may hope, by her
gracious influence on the Muses, wit will recover from its
apostasy; and that, by being encouraged in the interests
of virtue, it will strip vice of the gay habit in which it
has too long appeared, and clothe it in its native dress of
shame, contempt, and dishonour.</p>

<h3>PROLOGUE.</h3>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All the commanding powers that awe mankind</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Are in a trembling poet's audience joined,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where such bright galaxies of beauty sit,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And at their feet assembled men of wit:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Our author, therefore, owns his deep despair</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To entertain the learned or the fair;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet hopes that both will so much be his friends,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To pardon what he does, for what he intends;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He aims to make the coming action move</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On the dread laws of friendship and of love;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sure then he'll find but very few severe,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Since there's of both so many objects here.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He offers no gross vices to your sight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Those too much horror raise for just delight;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And to detain the attentive knowing ear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Pleasure must still have something that's severe.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If then you find our author treads the stage</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With just regard to a reforming age;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He hopes, he humbly hopes, you'll think there's due</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mercy to him, for justice done to you.</span><br />

<h3><i>THE LYING LOVER: OR, THE LADIES' FRIENDSHIP.</i></h3>


<h3>ACT THE FIRST.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>St. James's Park.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Young Bookwit</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Latine</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Latine.</i> But have you utterly left Oxford?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> For ever, sir, for ever;
my father has given me leave to come
to town, and I don't question but will
let my return be in my own choice.
But Jack, you know we were talking
in Maudlen Walks last week of the necessity, in intrigues,
of a faithful, yet a prating servant. We agreed, therefore,
to cast lots who should be the other's footman for
the present expedition. Fortune, that's always blind,
gave me the superiority.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> She shall be called no more so, for that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
action. And I am, sir, in a literal sense, your very
humble servant.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Begin, then, the duty of a useful valet, and
flatter me egregiously. Has the fellow fitted me? How
is my manner? my mien? Do I move freely? Have I
kicked off the trammels of a gown? or does not the tail
on't seem still tucked under my arm, where my hat is,
with a pert jerk forward, and little hitch in my gait like a
scholastic beau? This wig, I fear, looks like a cap.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> No, faith, it looks like a cap and gown too;
though at the same time you look as if you ne'er had
worn either.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> But my sword, does it hang careless? Do I
look bold, negligent, and erect? that is, do I look as if
I could kill a man without being out of humour? I
horridly mistrust myself. Am I military enough in my
air? I fancy people see I understand Greek. Don't I
pore a little in my visage? Han't I a down bookish
lour, a wise sadness? I don't look gay enough and
unthinking, I fancy.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> I protest you wrong yourself. You look very
brisk and very ignorant.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> O fie! I am afraid you flatter me.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> I don't indeed; I'll be hanged if my tutor would
know either of us. But, good master, to what use do
you design to put the noble arts and sciences he taught
us? The conduct of our lives, the government of our
passions, were his daily talk to us, good man!</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Good man! Why I'll obey his precepts, but
abridge 'em. For as he used to advise me, I'll contract
my thoughts, as I'll tell you, Jack:&mdash;for the passions, I'll
turn 'em all into that one dear passion, love; and when
that's the only torture of my heart, I'll give that tortured
heart quite away; deny there's any such thing as pain,
and turn stoic a shorter way than e'er thy tutor taught
thee. This is the new philosophy, you rogue you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> But you would not in earnest be thought wholly
illiterate?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> No; for as when I walk, I'd have you know
by my motion I can dance; so when I speak, I'd have
you see I read: yet would ordinarily neither cut capers
nor talk sentences. But you prate as if I came to town
to get an employment. No; hang business, hang care;
let it live and prosper among the men; I'll ne'er go
near the solemn ugly things again. I'll keep company
with none but ladies&mdash;bright ladies. O London!
London! O woman! woman! I am come where thou
livest, where thou shinest.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Hey day! why, were there no women in
Oxford?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> No, no; why, do you think a bed-maker's a
woman?</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Yes, and thought you knew it.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> No, no, 'tis no such thing. As he that is
not honest or brave is no man; so she that is not witty
or fair is no woman. No, no, Jack, to come up to that
high name and object of desire, she must be gay and
chaste, she must at once attract, and banish you. I
don't know how to express myself, but a woman, methinks,
is a being between us and angels. She has
something in her that at the same time gives awe and
invitation; and I swear to you I was never out in't yet,
but I always judged of men as I observed they judged of
women. There's nothing shows a man so much as the
object of his affections.&mdash;But what do you stare at so
considerately?</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Faith, sir, I am wondering at you&mdash;how 'tis possible
you could be so jaunty a town-spark in a moment,
and have so easy a behaviour. I look, methinks, to
you, as if I were really your footman.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Why, if you're serious in what you say, I
owe it wholly to the indulgence of an excellent father, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
whose company I was always free and unconstrained.
But what's this to ladies, Jack, to ladies? I was going
to tell you I had studied 'em, and know how to make
my approaches to 'em by contemplating their frame,
their inmost temper. I don't ground my hopes on the
scandalous tales and opinions your wild fellows have of
'em&mdash;fellows that are but mere bodies, machines&mdash;which
at best can but move gracefully. No; I draw my pretences
from philosophy&mdash;from nature.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> You'll give us by-and-by a lecture over your
mistress: you can dissect her.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> That I can, indeed, and have so accurately
observed on woman, that I can know her mind by her
eye as well as her doctor shall her health by her pulse;
I can read approbation through a glance of disdain; can
see when the soul is divided by a sparkling tear that
twinkles and betrays the heart. A sparkling tear's the
dress and livery of love&mdash;of love made up of hope and
fear, of joy and grief.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i><a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> But what have the wars to do with all this?
Why must you needs commence soldier all of a sudden?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Were't not a taking compliment with my
college face and phrase to accost a lady:&mdash;"Madam, I
bring your ladyship a learned heart, one newly come
from the University. If you want definitions, axioms,
and arguments, I am an able schoolman. I've read
Aristotle twice over, compared his jarring commentators
too, examined all the famous peripatetics, know where
the Scotists and the Nominals differ:"&mdash;this, certainly,
must needs enchant a lady.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> This is too much on th' other side.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> The name of soldier bids you better welcome. 'Tis
valour and feats done in the field a man
should be cried up for; nor is't so hard to achieve.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> The fame of it, you mean?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Yes; and that will serve. 'Tis but looking
big, bragging with an easy grace, and confidently mustering
up an hundred hard names they understand not:
Thunder out Villeroy, Catinat, and Boufflers; speak of
strange towns and castles, whose barbarous names, the
harsher they're to the ear, the rarer and more taking;
still running over lines, trenches, outworks, counterscarps,
and forts, citadels, mines, countermines, pickeering,
pioneers, sentinels, patrols, and others, without
sense or order; that matters not, the women are
amazed, they admire to hear you rap 'em out so
readily; and many a one that went no farther for it,
retailing handsomely some warlike terms, passes for a
brave fellow. Don't stand gaping, but live and learn,
my lad. I can tell thee ten thousand arts to make
thee known and valued in these regions of wit and
gallantry&mdash;the park, the playhouse.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Now you put me in mind where we are. What
have we to do here thus early, now there's no company?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Oh! sir, I have put on so much of the
soldier with my red coat, that I came here to observe
the ground I am to engage upon. Here must I act,
I know, some lover's part, and therefore came to view
this pleasant walk. I privately rambled to town last
November. Here, ay here, I stood and gazed at high
Mall, till I forgot it was winter, so many pretty shes
marched by me. Oh! to see the dear things trip, trip
along, and breathe so short, nipt with the season! I
saw the very air not without force leave their dear lips.
Oh! they were intolerably handsome.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> You'll see, perhaps, such to-day; but how to
come at 'em?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Ay, there's it, how to come at 'em.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i><a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Are you generous?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> I think I am no niggard.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> You must entertain them high, and bribe all
about them. They talk of Ovid and his Art of Loving;
be liberal, and you outdo his precepts. The art of love,
sir, is the art of giving. Be free to women, they'll be
free to you. Not every open-handed fellow hits it
neither. Some give by lapfulls, and yet ne'er oblige.
The manner, you know, of doing a thing is more than
the thing itself. Some drop a jewel, which had been
refused if bluntly offered.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Some lose at play what they design a
present.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Right; the skill is to be generous, and seem not
to know it of yourself, 'tis done with so much ease; but
a liberal blockhead presents his mistress as he'd give an
alms.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Leaving such blockheads to their deserved
ill-fortune, tell me if thou know'st these ladies?</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> No, not I, sir; they are above an academic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
converse many degrees. I've seen ten thousand verses writ
in the University on wenches not fit to be either of their
handmaids. I never spoke to such a fine thing as either
in my whole life&mdash;I'm downright asleep o' sudden. I
must fall back, and glad it is my place to do so; yet I
can get you intelligence perhaps. I'll to the footman.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Do you think he'll tell?</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> He would not to you, perhaps, but to a brother
footman. Do but listen at the entrance of the Mall at
noon, and you'll have all the ladies' characters in town
among their lackeys. You know all fame begins from
our domestics.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> That was a wise man's observation. Follow
him, and know what you can. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Latine</span>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Penelope, Victoria, Simon</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lettice</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Pen.</i> A walk round would be too much for us; we'll
keep the Mall.&mdash;But to our talk: I must confess I have
terrors when I think of marrying Lovemore. He is,
indeed, a man of an honest character. He has my good
opinion, but love does not always follow that. He is so
wise a fellow, always so precisely in the right, so observing
and so jealous; he's blameless indeed, but not to be
commended. What good he has, has no grace in it;
he's one of those who's never highly moved, except to
anger. Give me a man that has agreeable faults rather
than offensive virtues.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Offensive virtues, madam?</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Yes, I don't know how&mdash;there's a sort of virtue,
or prudence, or what you'll call it, that we can but just
approve. That does not win us. Lovemore wants that
fire, that conversation-spirit I would have. They say
he's learned as well as discreet, but I'm no judge of that.
I'm sure he's no woman's scholar; his wisdom he should
turn into wit, and his learning into poetry or humour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Well, I'm not so much of your mind; I like a
sober passion.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> A sober passion! you took me up just now when
I said an offensive virtue.&mdash;Bless me!
[<i>Stumbling almost to a fall.</i></p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i><a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> [<i>Catching her.</i>] How much am I indebted
to an accident, that favours me with an occasion of this
small service! for 'tis to me an happiness beyond expression
thus to kiss your hand.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> The occasion, methinks, is not so obliging, nor
the happiness you mention worth that name, sir.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> 'Tis true, madam, I owe it all to fortune;
neither your kindness nor my industry had any share in't.
Thus am I still as wretched as I was, for this happiness
I so much prize had doubtless been refused my want
of merit.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> It has very soon, you see, lost what you valued
in it; but I find you and I, sir, have a different sense;
for, in my opinion, we enjoy with most pleasure what we
attain with least merit. Merit is a claim, and may pretend
justly to favour; when without it what's conferred
is more unexpected, and therefore more pleasing.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> You talk very well, madam, of an happiness
you can't possibly be acquainted with, the enjoying without
desert. But indeed you have done me a very singular
good office, in letting me know myself very much qualified
for felicity.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> I swear he's a very pretty fellow, and how
readily the thing talks! I begin to pity Lovemore, but I
begin to hate Penelope. How he looks! he looks at her!</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i><a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> But judge, madam, what the condition of a
passionate man must be, that can approach the hand
only of her he dies for, when her heart is inaccessible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> 'Tis very well the heart lies not so easily to be
seized as the hand&mdash;I find&mdash;&mdash;Pray, sir&mdash;I don't know
what there is in this very odd fellow: I'm not angry,
though he's downright rude&mdash;but I must&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> But your heart, madam, your heart&mdash;[<i>Pressingly.</i></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> You seemed, sir, I must confess, to have shown
a ready civility when I'd like to fall just now, for which
I could not but thank you, and permit you to say what
you pleased on that occasion&mdash;"But your heart, madam!"
'tis a sure sign, sir, you know not me; or, if you are
what indeed you seem&mdash;a gentleman&mdash;sure you forget
yourself, or rather you talk, by memory, a form or cant
which you mistake for something that's gallant.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Madam, I very humbly beg your pardon, if
I pressed too far and too abruptly. I forgot, indeed,
that I broke through decencies, and that though you
have been long a familiar to me, I am a stranger to you.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Pray, familiar stranger, what can you mean? I
never saw you before this instant, nor you me, I believe.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i><a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Perhaps not, that you know of, madam, for
your humility, it seems, makes you so little sensible of
your own perfection, that you overlook your conquest;
nor have you e'er observed me, though I hover day and
night about your lodging, haunt you from place to place,
at balls, in the park, at church. I gave you all the
serenades you've had, yet never till this minute could I
find you, and this minute an unfortunate one&mdash;But this
is always my luck when I'm out of the field.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> You've travelled then, and seen the wars, sir?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> I&mdash;madam&mdash;I&mdash;all that I know of the matter
is, that Louis the Fourteenth mortally hates me. They
talk of French gold&mdash;what heaps have I refused! Yet to
be generous even to an enemy, I must allow that Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
has reason for his rancour to me. There has not been a
skirmish, siege, or battle since I bore arms, I made not
one in; no, nor the least advantage got of the enemy, but
I had my share, though perhaps not all my share of the
glory. You've seen my name, though you don't know it,
often in the <i>Gazette</i>.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> I never read news.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Latine</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lat.</i> What tale's he telling now, tro'?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> You've never heard, I suppose, of such
names as Ruremonde, Kaiserswerth, and Liege? nor read
of an English gentleman left dead by his precipitancy
upon a parapet at Venloo? I was thought so indeed, when
the first account came away. Every man has his failings;
rashness is my fault.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Don't you remember a certain place called
Oxford among your towns, sir?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Pshaw, away&mdash;Oh! oh!&mdash;I beg your pardon,
ladies, this fellow knows I was shot in my left arm, and
cannot bear the least touch, yet will still be rushing on
me.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> He has a lie, I think, in every joint. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Do you bear any commission, sir?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> There's an intimate of mine, a general officer,
who has often said, Tom, if thou would'st but stick to
any one application, thou might'st be anything. 'Tis my
misfortune, madam, to have a mind too extensive. I
began last summer's campaign with the renowned Prince
Eugene, but was forced to fly into Holland for a duel
with that rough Captain of the Hussars, Paul Diack. They
talk of a regiment for me, but those things&mdash;besides, it
will oblige me to attend it, and then I can't follow
honour where'er she's busiest, but must be confined to
one nation; when indeed 'tis rather my way of serving
with such of our allies as most want me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> But I see you soldiers never enjoy such a thing
as rest: You but come home in winter to turn your
valour on the ladies&mdash;'tis but just a change of your warfare.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> I had immediately returned to Holland, but
your beauties at my arrival here disarmed me, madam,
made me a man of peace, or raised a civil war within me
rather. You took me prisoner at first sight, and to your
charms I yielded up an heart, till then unconquered.
Martial delights (once best and dearest to me) vanished
before you in a moment, and all my thoughts grew bent
to please and serve you.</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> Lovemore's in the walk, madam; he'll be in a fit.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Rob me o' the sudden thus of all my happiness!
Yet ere you quite forsake me, authorise my
passion, license my innocent flames, and give me leave
to love such charming sweetness.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> He that will love, and knows what 'tis to love,
will ask no leave of any but himself. [<i>Exeunt</i> Ladies, <i>etc.</i></p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Follow 'em, Jack.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> I know as much of 'em already as needs: the
footman was in his talking vein. The handsomer of the
two, says he, I serve, and she lives in the Garden.</p>

<p><i>Y Book.</i> What Garden?</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Covent Garden; the other lies there too. I did
not stay to ask her name, but I shall meet him again; I
took particular notice of the livery.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Ne'er trouble thyself to know which is which,
my heart and my good genius tell me, 'tis she, that pretty
she I talked to.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> If, with respect to your worship's opinion, I might
presume to be of a contrary one, I should think the other
the handsomer now.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> What, the dumb thing,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> the picture?&mdash;No,
love is the union of minds, and she that engages mine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
must be very well able to express her own. But I
suppose some scolding landlady has made you thus
enamoured with silence. But here are two of the dearest
of my old comrades&mdash;they seem amazed at something by
their action.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i><a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> How! a collation on the water, and music too?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Yes, music and a collation.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Last night?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Last night too.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> An handsome treat?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> A very noble one.</p>

<p><i>Fred,</i> Who gave it?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> That I'm yet to learn.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> How happy am I to meet you here!</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> When I embrace you thus, no happiness can
equal mine. [<i>Saluting.</i></p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> I thrust myself intrudingly upon you; but
you'll pardon a man o'erjoyed to see you.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Where you're always welcome you never can
intrude.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> What were you talking of?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Of an entertainment.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Given by some lover?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> As we suppose.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> That circumstance deserves my curiosity;
pray go on, and let me share the story.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Some ladies had the fiddles last night.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Upon the water, too, methought you said?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Yes, 'twas upon the water.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Water often feeds the flame.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Sometimes.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> And by night too?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Yes, last night.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> He chose his time well&mdash;The lady is handsome?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> In most men's eyes she is.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> And the music?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Good, as we hear.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Some banquet followed?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> A sumptuous one, they say.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> And neither of you all this while know who
gave this treat? ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> D'ye laugh at it?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> How can I choose, to see you thus admire a
slight divertisement I gave myself?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> You?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Even I!</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Why, have you got a mistress here already?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> I should be sorry else. I've been in town
this month or more, though for some reasons I appear
but little yet by day. I' the dark o' the evening I peep
out, and incognito make some visits. Thus had I spent
my time but ill, were not&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Y. Book</span>.] Do you know what you say, sir?
Don't lay it on so thick.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lat</span>.] Nay, you must be sure to take
care to be in the way as soon as they land, to shew upstairs&mdash;I
beg pardon, I was giving my fellow some directions
about receiving some women of quality that sup
with me to-night incog&mdash;&mdash;but you're my dearest friends,
and shall hear all.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Love</span>.] How luckily your rival discovers
himself!</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> I took five barges, and the fairest kept for
my company; the other four I filled with music of all
sorts, and of all sorts the best; in the first were fiddles,
in the next theorbo, lutes, and voices.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Flutes and such pastoral instruments i' th' third.<br />
Loud music from the fourth did pierce the air.<br />
Each concert vied by turns,<br />
Which with most melody should charm our ears.<br />
The fifth, the largest of 'em all, was neatly hung,<br />
Not with dull tapestry, but with green boughs,<br />
Curiously interlaced to let in air,<br />
And every branch with jessamines, and orange posies decked;<br />
In this the feast was kept.<br />
Hither, with five other ladies, I led her whose beauty alone
governs my destiny. Supper was served up straight; I
will not trouble you with our bill of fare, what dishes
were best liked, what sauces most recommended; 'tis
enough I tell you this delicious feast was of six courses,
twelve dishes to a course.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> That's indeed enough of all conscience. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Oh, the torture of jealousy! [<i>Aside</i>]&mdash;But, sir,
how seemed the lady to receive this entertainment? We
must know that.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Oh! that was the height on't. She, I warrant
you, was quite negligent of all this matter. You know
their way, they must not seem to like&mdash;no, I warrant it
would not so much as smile to make the fellow vain, and
believe he had power to move delight in her&mdash;ha, ha!</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> But how then?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Why you must know my humour grew poetic.
I pulled off my sword-knot, and with that bound up a
coronet of ivy, laurel, and flowers; with that round my
temples, and a plate of richest fruits in my hand, on one
knee I presented her with it as a cornucopia, an offering
from her humble swain of all his harvest&mdash;to her the
Ceres of our genial feast and rural mirth. She smiled;
the ladies clapped their hands, and all our music struck
sympathetic rapture at my happiness; while gentle winds,
the river, air, and shore echoed the harmony in notes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
more soft than they received it. Methought all nature
seemed to die for love like me. To all my heart and
every pulse beat time. Oh, the pleasures of successful
love! ha, Lovemore! ha! What, hast thou got a good
office lately? you're afraid I should make some request.
Prithee ben't so shy, I have nothing to ask but of my
mistress&mdash;What's the matter?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> I only attend, sir, I only attend&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Then I'll go on. As soon<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> as we had supped,
the fireworks played. Squibs of all sorts were darted
through the skies, whose spreading fires made a new day.
A flaming deluge seemed to fall from Heaven, and with
such violence attacked the waves, you would have thought
the fiery element had left his sphere, to ruin his moist
enemy. Their contest done, we landed, danced till day,
which hasty Sol disturbed us with too soon. Had he
taken our advice, or feared my anger, he might in Thetis's
lap have slept as long as at Alcmena's labour he's reported.
But steering not as we would have prescribed,
he put a period to our envied mirth.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Trust me, you tell us wonders, and with a grace
as rare as the feast itself, which all our summer's mirth
can't equal.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> My mistress took me o' the sudden; I had
not a day's warning.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> The treat was costly though, and finely ordered.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> I was forced to take up with this trifle. He
that wants time can't do as he would.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Farewell, we shall meet again at more leisure.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Number me among your creatures.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Oh jealousy! Thou rack, jealousy!</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Love</span>.] What reason have you to feel it?
the circumstances of the feast nothing agree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Love. [To</i> <span class="smcap">Fred</span>.] In time and place they do; the rest
is nothing. [<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Fred</span>. <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Love</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i><a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> May I speak now, sir, without offence?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> 'Tis in your choice now to speak or not,
but before company you'll spoil all.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Do you walk abroad and talk in your sleep? or
do you use to tell your dreams for current truth?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Dull brain!</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Why, you beat out mine with your battles, your
fireworks, your music, and your feasts. You've found an
excellent way to go to the wars, and yet keep out of danger.
Then you feast your mistresses at the cheapest rate that
ever I knew! Why d'ye make 'em believe you ha' been
here these six weeks?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> My passion has the more growth, and I the
better ground to make love.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> You'd make one believe fine things, that would
but hearken to you; but this lady might soon have found
you out.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Some acquaintance I have got, however; this
is making love, scholar, and at the best rate too.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> To speak truth, I'm hardly come to myself yet;
your great supper lies on my stomach still. I defy
Pontack<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> to have prepared a better o' the sudden. Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
enchanted castles, where strangers found strange tables
strangely furnished with strange cates, were but sixpenny
ordinaries to the fifth barge; you were an excellent man
to write romances, for having feasts and battles at command,
your Quixote in a trice would over-run the world;
revelling and skirmishing cost you nothing; then you
vary your scene with so much ease, and shift from court
to camp with such facility&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> I love thus to outvie a newsmonger; and as
soon as I perceive a fellow thinks his story will surprise, I
choke him with a stranger, and stop his mouth with
an extempore wonder. Did'st thou but know what a
pleasure 'tis to cram their own news down their throats
again!</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> 'Tis fine, but may prove dangerous sport, and
may involve us in a peck of troubles. Prithee, Tom,
consider that I am of quality to be kicked or caned by
this l&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Hush, hush, call it not lying; as for my
waging war, it is but just I snatch and steal from fortune
that fame which she denies me opportunity to deserve.
My father has cramped me in a college, while all the
world has been in action. Then as to my lying to my
mistress, 'tis but what all the lovers upon earth do. Call
it not then by that coarse name, a lie. 'Tis wit, 'tis fable,
allegory, fiction, hyperbole&mdash;or be it what you call it, the
world's made up almost of nothing else. What are all
the grave faces you meet in public? mere silent lies,
dark solemn fronts, by which they would disguise vain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
empty silly noddles. But after all, to be serious, since I
am resolved honestly to love, I don't care how artfully I
obtain the woman I pitch upon; besides, did you ever
know any of them acknowledge they loved as soon as
they loved? No, they'll let a man dwell upon his knees&mdash;whom
they languish to receive into their arms. They're
no fair enemy. Therefore 'tis but just that&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We use all arts the fair to undermine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And learn with gallantry to hide design. [<i>Exeunt.</i></span><br />

<h3>ACT THE SECOND.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Penelope's</span> <i>Lodgings, Covent Garden.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Old Bookwit, Penelope</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lettice</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Old Book.</i> Mistress Penelope, I have
your father's leave to wait upon
you, madam, and talk to you this
morning; nay, to talk to you of
marriage.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> To talk to me of marriage,
sir?</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> Yes, madam, in behalf of my son, Tom
Bookwit.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Nay, there may perhaps be something said to
that. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i><a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> I sent for him from Oxford with that design.
He came to town but yesterday; and, if a father can
judge, he brings from a college the mien and air of a
court. I love my son entirely, and hope, madam, you
take my thoughts as to you, to be no want of respect to
you.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> 'Twere want of sense, sir, to do that.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> If I can remember my style to my mistress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
of old, I'll ease Tom's way, and raise her expectation of
my son. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Madam, had I my hat, my feather,
pantaloons, and jerkin on, as when I wooed your humble
servant's mother, I would deliver you his errand. I
married her just such a young thing as you; her complexion
was charming, but not indeed with all your
sweetness.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Oh! sir!</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> Her neck and bosom were the softest pillows;
her shape was not of that nice sort. Some young women
suffer in shapes of their mother's making, by spare diet,
straight lacing, and constant chiding. But 'twas the work
of nature, free, unconstrained, healthy, and&mdash;&mdash;But her
charms had not all that emanation which yours have.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> O fie! fie!</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> Not those thousand thousand graces, that
soft army of loves and zephyrs, millions of airy beings
that attend around you, and appear only to the second
sight of lovers.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> O fie! Pray, good sir, you'll leave nothing for
your son to say.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> I did not think I had such a memory. I
find the women are now certainly daughters of the women
before 'em: Flattery still does it. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Tom is my
only son, and I extremely desire to have him settled. I
own I think him of much merit.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> He would derogate from his birth were he not
much a gentleman. But to receive a man in the character
of a pretender at first sight&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> I'll walk him by and by before your window,
where your own eyes shall judge. I think there's nothing
above his pretences but yourself; but when one of so
many excellent qualities bestows herself, it must be condescension.
You shall not answer&mdash;Farewell, daughter;
we are but too apt to believe what we wish.
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Old Book</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> 'Tis as you said, Lettice, Old Bookwit came to
propose his son.</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> I overheard the old gentleman talk of it last
night. But, madam, you han't heard the song that was
made on you. Oh! 'tis mighty pretty! The gentleman is
dying for you, he says it. Pure, pure verses.</p>

<p><i>Pen,</i> Whoever writ 'em, he's not the first poet I have
made. They may talk, and say nature makes a poet,
but I say love makes a poet. Don't you see elder
brothers, who are by nature born above wit, shall fall in
love, and write verses: nay, and pretty good ones, considering
they can tag 'em to settlements. But let's see.</p>

<p>[<i>Reading.</i>] "<span class="smcap">To Celia's Spinet</span>.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Thou soft machine that dost her hand obey,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Tell her my grief in thy harmonious lay."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Poor man!</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"To shun my moan to thee she'll fly;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To her touch be sure reply,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And, if she removes it, die."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The device is just and truly poetical.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Know thy bliss&mdash;"</span><br />
</p>

<p>Ay, ay, there I come in.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Know thy bliss, with rapture shake,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Tremble o'er all thy numerous make;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Speak in melting sounds my tears,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Speak my joys, my hopes, my fears&mdash;"</span><br />
</p>

<p>Which all depend upon me.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Thus force her, when from me she'd fly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By her own hand, like me, to die."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Well, certainly nothing touches the heart of woman so
much as poetry. I suppose the master is in the next
room. 'Tis his hour; desire him to walk in. 'Twill
make one's ears tingle, a song on one's self!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Here the song is performed to a spinet.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, dost think, Lettice, my grave lover writ this fine
thing&mdash;say'st thou?</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> No, madam, nobody writes songs on those they
are sure of.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Sure of me! the insolent!</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> Nay, I know no more but that he said he'd turn
me away as soon as he had married you.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> 'Tis like enough; that's the common practice of
your jealous-headed fellows. Well, I have a good mind
to dress myself anew, put on my best looks, and send for
him to dismiss him. I know he loves me.</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> I never knew him show it but by his jealousy.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> As you say, a jealous fellow love! 'tis all mistake&mdash;'tis
only for himself he has desires; nor cares what the
object of his wishes suffers so he himself has satisfaction.&mdash;No,
he has a gluttony, an hunger for me.</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> An hunger for you! I protest, madam, if you'd
let me be his cook, and make you ready, I'd poison him.
But I'm glad Simon disobeyed you, and told the gentleman's
servant who you were, and your lodging.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Did the rogue do so? Call him hither.</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> Simon, why Simon!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Simon</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Sirrah, I find I must at last turn you off, you saucy
fellow. Don't stand staring and dodging with your feet,
and wearing out your livery hat with squeezing for an
excuse, but answer me, and that presently.</p>

<p><i>Sim.</i> I will, madam, as soon as you ask me a question.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Not afore then&mdash;Mr. Pert, don't you know, you
told the gentleman's footman in the park who I was,
against my constant order, when I walk early. Come,
sirrah, tell all that passed between you.</p>

<p><i>Sim.</i> Why, madam, the gentleman's gentleman came
up to me very civilly, and said his master was in discourse
with my lady, he supposed; then he fell into talk about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
vails<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>&mdash;about profits in a service; at last, after a deal of
civil discourse between us&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Come, without this preamble, what he asked you,
impertinence; tell that, do.</p>

<p><i>Sim.</i> He asked about you, and Madam Victoria. I
said the handsomest of the two is my lady.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Speak on boldly, Simon; I'm never angry at a
servant that speaks truth.</p>

<p><i>Sim.</i> He told me he should be very proud of my
acquaintance. Indeed, madam, the man was very well
spoken, and showed a great deal of respect for me, on
your ladyship's account. He is a mighty well spoken
man, and said he found I was a smart gentleman; said
he'd come again.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Go, you have done your business. Go down.
[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> Well, after all, madam, I did not think that
gentleman displeased you.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i><a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Had but young Bookwit his mien and conversation,
how easily would he exclude Lovemore!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Ser.</i> Mr. Lovemore is coming up, madam.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> He has not heard, sure, of this new proposal!</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> 'Tis possible he may, and come to rant or upbraid
your ladyship. I wonder you endure him on these
occasions.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> I'll rack his very heart-strings. He shall know
all that man e'er suffered for his native mistress, woman.</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> His father, madam, has been so long coming out
of Suffolk&mdash;-There are strange tricks in the world, but 'tis
not my place to speak.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> However, his father, may come at last. I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
not wholly lose him; as bad as he is, he's better than
no husband at all. Stay in the room; I'll talk to you
as if he were not present.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lovemore</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Love.</i><a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Ah! Penelope! inconstant, fickle Penelope!</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> But, Lettice, you don't tell me what the gentleman
said. Now there's nobody here, you may speak.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Now there's nobody here? Then I am a thing,
a utensil! I am nobody, I have no essence that I am
sensible of! I think 'twill be so soon!&mdash;This ingrate&mdash;this
perjured!</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Tell me, I say, how the match happened to break
off?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> This is downright abuse! What! don't you see
me, madam?</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> He had the folly, upon her being commonly civil
to him, to talk of directing her affairs before his time. In
the first place, he thought it but necessary her maid, her
faithful servant, Mrs. Betty, should be removed.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Her faithful servant, Mrs. Betty? Her betrayer,
her whisperer, Mrs. Lettice! Madam, would you but
hear me? I will be heard!</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Prithee step, Lettice, and see what noise is that
without.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> The noise is here, madam; 'tis I that make
what you call noise. 'Tis I that claim aloud my right
and speak to all the world the wrongs I suffer.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Cooling herbs, well steeped&mdash;a good anodyne at
night, made of the juice of hellebore, with very thin diet,
may be of use in these cases.
[<i>Both looking at him as disturbed.</i></p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Cases! what cases? I shall downright run mad
with this damned usage! Am I a jest?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> A jest? No, faith, this is far from a merry madness.
Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Harkee, Lettice, I'll downright box you. Hold
your tongue, gipsy.</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> Dear madam, save me! Go you to him.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Let him take you.&mdash;Bless me, how he stares!
Take her.</p>

<p><i>Lett. Pen.</i> Take her. [<i>Running round each other.</i></p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Very fine!&mdash;No, madam, your gallant, your spark
last night; your fine dancer, entertainer, shall take you.
He that was your swain; and you, I warrant, a fantastic
nymph of the flood or forest. Ha! ha! ha! To be out
all night with a young fellow! Oh! that makes you
change your countenance, does it so? Fine lady&mdash;you
wonder how I came to know. Why, choose a discreeter
the next time&mdash;he told me all himself. Swoon&mdash;die for
shame at hearing of these words&mdash;do!</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> I am, indeed, downright ashamed for him that
speaks 'em. Whence this insolence, if not from utter distraction,
under this roof?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Oh, the ingrate! Have not I, madam, two long
years, two ages, with humblest resignation, depended on
your smile? and shall I suffer one of yesterday's to
treat you, to dance all night with you?</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i><a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Speak softly; my father's coming down.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Thy father's coming down! Faithless! Thou
hast no father&mdash;But to cross me by night upon the
water!</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Well, by night upon the water; what then?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Yes, all night.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> What of that?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Without blushing when you hear of 't!</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Blush for what? What do you drive at?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Can you, then, coolly ask what 'tis I mean, thou
reveller, thou rambler? A fine young lady, with your
midnight frolics! But what do I pretend to? I know
not how with bended knees to call you Ceres; make
you an offering of summer fruits, and deify your vanity!
Thou art no goddess; thou'rt a very woman, with all the
guile! Your barges! your treats! your fireworks!</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> What means the insolent? You grow insufferable!</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Oh, Penelope! that look, that disdainful look
has pierced my soul, and ebbed my rage to penitence and
sorrow. I own my fault; I'm too rash&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> The imaginary enemies you raise are but mere
forms of your sickly brain: so I think, and scorn 'em. A
diffident, a humorous, and ungenerous man, who, without
grounds, calls me inconstant, shall surely find me so.
She will be very happy that takes a constant man with
twenty thousand humours.</p>

<p>
<i>Love.</i> Is it a fault my life's bound up in thee,<br />
That all my powers change with thy looks,<br />
That my eyes gloat on thee when thou'rt present,<br />
And ache and roll for light when thou'rt absent?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> A little ill-usage, I see, improves a lover. I
never heard him speak so well in my life before. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Love.</i> Of you I am not jealous:<br />
'Tis my own indesert<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> that gives me fears,<br />
And tenderness forms dangers where they're not;<br />
I doubt and envy all things that approach thee:<br />
Not a fond mother of a long-wished-for only child beholds
with such kind terrors her infant offspring, as I do her
I love. She thinks its food, if she's not by, unwholesome;
and all the ambient air made up of fevers and of quartan
agues, except she shrouds it in her arms. Such is my
unpitied, anxious care for you; and can I see another&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> What other?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Nay, if you make a secret of your meeting,
there's all that I suspect in it. Another? Young Bookwit
is another&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> I never saw his face. Young Bookwit?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> What! not though he solicited a glance, with
symphonies of charming note, with sumptuous dishes?
Not when the flying meteors from the earth made a new
day? Not see him? Oh, that was hard; that was
unkind! Not one look for all this gallantry?&mdash;But love
is blind. You can be all night with the son, all day with
the father, and never see either. His father was here
this morning.&mdash;Seek not to excuse: I find your arts, and
see their aim too. Go, go, take your Bookwit; forget
your lover, as he now must you. [<i>Going.</i></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Hear but three words.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> What shall they be?</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Prithee hear me.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> No, no, your father's coming down.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> He's not coming, nor can he overhear us. There's
time and privacy enough to disabuse you.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> I'll hear nothing unless you will be married;
unless you give me, as a present earnest of yourself, three
kisses, and your word for ever.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> To give way to my satisfaction, then, and be
friends again, you would, Mr. Lovemore, have three
kisses&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Three kisses, your faith and hand.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Nothing else? Will you be so contented?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> I'll expect higher terms if you accept not these&mdash;Quickly,
then.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Well, then&mdash;no, my father's coming. Ha! ha!
ha!</p>

<p>
<i>Love.</i> Laugh at my sufferings! slight my anger!<br />
Is this your base requital of my love?&mdash;<br />
Revenge, revenge! I'll print on thy favourite in his
heart's blood my revenge. Our swords&mdash;our swords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
shall dispute our pretences, rather than he enjoy what
my long services entitle me to, which is to do myself
right for what he intends an injury; though perhaps
what we shall dispute for is better lost.</p>

<p><i>Pert.</i> Mr. Lovemore, you have taken very great
liberties. You say I have injured you in my regard
to another. Is your opinion, then, of what you say you
will dispute for, such as you just now said&mdash;better
lost?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Look you, madam&mdash;so&mdash;therefore&mdash;as to that&mdash;this
is such&mdash;for that it&mdash;You don't consider what you
said to me.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> You shall by all that's&mdash;you shall repent this.
[<i>Flings out.</i></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> This is all we have for 't, a little dominion beforehand.
These are the creatures that are born to rule us;
who creep, who flatter, and servilely beseech our favour;
which obtained, they grow sullen, proud, and insolent;
pry into the gift, the manner of bestowing, with all the
little arts the ungrateful use to hide, or kill their sense
and conscience of a benefit.</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> Ay, ay, madam, 'tis so. I had a sweetheart
once, a lady's butler, to whom I gave a lock of my hair,
and the villain, when we quarrelled, told me half of them
were grey.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Ha! ha! ha! the ingrate&mdash;the faithless, as Lovemore
says.</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> And yet, madam, the rogue stole a letter out of a
book to ask me for it, as my next suitor found out.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> However, I am sure 'tis in my fate to be subject
to one of them very suddenly.</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> Ah! madam! the gentleman this morning&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> The fellow's very well, and I am mightily mistaken
if my cousin Victoria did not think so.</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> And so do you heartily. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Yet I wish I had seen this young Bookwit before
Lovemore came to-day.</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i><a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> I'll tell you how, madam. Victoria has ne'er a
lover, and is your entire friend. Now, madam, suppose
you got her to write a letter to this young gentleman in
her own name. You meet him under that name incognito;
then, if an accident should happen, both you and she
will be safe, and puzzle the truth: you never writ to him,
she never met him.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> A lucky thought&mdash;step to her immediately. I'll
come to her, or she to me.</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> I fly, I fly. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> This is, indeed, a lucky hint of the wench, in
which I have another drift, too. Now shall I sift my
friend Victoria, and perfectly understand whether she
likes that agreeable young fellow; for if her reserved
humour easily falls in with this design on Bookwit, she's
certainly smitten with the other, and suspects me to be
so too&mdash;What is this dear, this sudden intruder, love,
that Victoria's long and faithful friendship, Lovemore's
anxious and constant passion, both vanish before it in a
moment? Why are our hearts so accessible at our eyes?&mdash;My
dear&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Victoria</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lettice</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Dear Pen, I ran to you. Well, what is it?</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Set chairs, and the bohea tea, and leave us.
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Lett.</span>] Dear Victoria, you have always been my
most intimate bosom friend; your wary carriage and
circumspection have often been a safety against errors to
me&mdash;I must confess it. [<i>Filling her tea.</i></p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> But, my dear, why this preface to me? To the
matter&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> You know all that has passed between me and
Mr. Lovemore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> I have always approved him, and do now more
than ever; for 'tis not a mien and air that makes that
worthy creature, a kind husband; but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> True, but here was old Bookwit this morning,
with my father's authority to talk to me of the subject of
love.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Nay, madam, if so, and you can resolve to obey
your father&mdash;I contend not for Lovemore; for though the
young men of this age are so very vicious, so expensive,
both of their health and fortune&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> How zealous she is to put me out of her way!
False creature! [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;But, my dear friend, you don't
take me; your friendship outruns my explanation. 'Twas
for his son at Oxford he came to me: He is to walk
with him before the door that I may view him, by-and-by.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Nay, as one must obey their parents wholly, I
think a raw young man that never saw the town is better
than an old one that has run through all its vices. I
congratulate your good fortune. There's a great estate;
and he knows nothing&mdash;just come to town. The furniture
and the horse-cloths will be all your own device for
the wedding, and the horses when and where you please.
He knows no better.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> But one shall be so long teaching a raw creature
a manner.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Never let him have one; 'twill make him like
himself, and think of making advances elsewhere: You'd
better have him a booby.&mdash;How could I think of the old
fellow for you! Look you, Pen, old age has its infirmities,
and 'tis a sad prospect for an honest young
woman to be sure of being a nurse, and never of being a
mother.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Oh, that I had but your prudence! But, my
dear, I have a request to make to you, and that is that
you would write him an assignation this evening in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Park. I'll obey the appointment, and converse with him
under that disguise; for the old people will clap up a
match before I know anything of the real man. And if
one don't know one's husband, how can one manage him&mdash;that
is to say, obey him?</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Oh! pray, my dear, do you think I don't understand
you? Oh! and there's another thing&mdash;a scholar
makes the best husband in the world.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Because they are the most knowing?</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> No, because they are the least knowing.&mdash;But
I'll go immediately and obey your commands. I wish
you heartily well, my dear, in this matter. [<i>Kissing her.</i></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> I thank you, dearest; I don't doubt it indeed.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Where are you going now, my dear? O
fie! this is not like a friend&mdash;Do I use you so, dear
madam?</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Nay, indeed, madam, I must wait on you.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Indeed you shan't&mdash;indeed you shan't.
[<span class="smcap">Pen.</span> <i>follows</i> <span class="smcap">Vict.</span></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Well, madam, will you promise, then, to be as
free with me?&mdash;Thus does she hope to work me out of
my lover, by being made my confident&mdash;but that baseness
has been too fashionable to pass any more. I have not
trusted her, the cunning creature. I begin to hate her so&mdash;I'll
never be a minute from her. [<i>Exit.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>Covent Garden.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Old Bookwit, Young Bookwit</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Latine</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> Well, Tom, where have you sauntered about
since I saw you? Is not the town mightily increased
since you were in it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Ay, indeed, I need not have been so impatient
to have left Oxford. Had I stayed a year longer,
they had builded to me.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> But I don't observe you affected much with
the alterations. Where have you been?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> No, faith, the New Exchange<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> has taken up
all my curiosity.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> Oh! but, son, you must not go to places
to stare at women! Did you buy anything?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Some baubles. But my choice was so distracted
among the pretty merchants and their dealers, I
knew not where to run first. One little, lisping rogue&mdash;"Ribbandths,
gloveths, tippeths"&mdash;"Sir," cries another,
"will you buy a fine sword-knot?" Then a third pretty
voice and curtsey&mdash;"Does not your lady want hoods,
scarfs, fine green silk stockings?"<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> I went by as if I
had been in a seraglio, a living gallery of beauties, staring
from side to side&mdash;I bowing, they laughing&mdash;so made my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
escape, and brought your son and heir safe to you, through
all these darts and glances, to which indeed my breast
is not impregnable. But I wonder whence I had this
amorous inclination?</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> Whoever you had it from, sirrah, 'tis your
business to correct it, by fixing it upon a proper object&mdash;But,
Tom, you know I am always glad to hear you talk
with the gaiety before me that you do elsewhere. But I
have now something of consequence (that sudden, serious
look was so like me). [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;What I am going to say
now, I tell you is extraordinary.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> I could not indeed help some seeming
extravagancies I have been forced to. But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> I do not grudge you your expenses, I was
not going to speak on it. For I decay, and so do my
desires, while yours grow still upon you. Therefore,
what may be spared from mine, I heartily give you to
supply yours; 'tis but the just order of things. I scorn
to hoard what I only now can gaze at, while your youth
and person want those entertainments you may become
and taste. All your just pleasures are mine also; in
you my youth and gayer years methinks I feel repeated.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book</i> Then what can give you, sir, uneasiness?</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> Your affectation of a soldier's dress; makes
me think you bent upon a dangerous though noble
course; that you'll expose a life, that's dearer to your
father than yourself, to daily hazards. I, therefore, have
resolved to settle thee,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and chosen a young lady, witty,
prudent, rich, and fair&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Oh, Victoria! [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;You cannot move
too slowly in such a business.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> Nay, 'tis no sudden thing. Her father and
I have been old acquaintance, and I was so confident of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
her worth, and your compliance, that I can't with honour
disengage myself.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> How, sir! when honour calls me to the
field, where I may perpetuate your name by some brave
exploit&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> You may do it much better, Tom, at
home, by a brave boy. Come, come, it must be
so&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> What shall I do for some invention?
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> Let it be so, dear Tom; it must be so.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> What if it be impossible?</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> Impossible! as how?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Upon my knees I beg your pardon, sir; I
am&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> At Oxford&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> What art thou at Oxford? Rise and tell
me.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Why I am married there, since you needs
must know.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> Married, without my consent!</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> There was a force upon me; you'll easily get
all annulled if you desire it. It was the crossest, most
unhappy accident. Yet, indeed, she is an excellent
creature!</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> How could he conceal this all this while from me?
But I remember he used to be out of the college whole
nights, we knew not where. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Penelope</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Victoria</span> <i>at the window.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Pen.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] The very man we met this morning; and
I employ my rival to write to him! How confidently she
stares at the fellow, and observes his action!</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Betty, do you see with what intent and with what
fire in her eyes Penelope gazes yonder? But take you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
that letter and give it when the old gentleman's gone.
Goodness! how concerned she seems! Well, some
women!&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Exeunt Ladies from above.</i></p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> Let that pass, since the business is irrevocable.
What is her name?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Matilda, and her father's, Newtown.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> They're names I never heard before; but go
on.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> This lady, sir, I saw in a public assembly;
at the first sight she made me hers for ever. From that
instant I languished, nor had vital heat out of her
presence. The sun to me shed influence in vain; he
rose and set both unobserved, nor was to any living this
human life so much a dream as me. All this she observed,
but not untouched observed. She shewed a
noble gratitude to a noble passion; favours I soon
received, but severely modest ones.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Oh! that's pre-supposed; you, to be sure, would
ne'er desire any other. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Y. Book.</i> We had contrived to meet o'nights,<br />
The sweetest hours of love; and there was I<br />
One evening in her lodging&mdash;'Twas, as I remember,<br />
Yes, 'twas on the second of December;<br />
That's the very night I was caught&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> 'Tis strange, a fellow of his wit to be trepanned
into a marriage&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Her father supped abroad that night, which
made us think ourselves secure. But coming home by
accident sooner than we expected, we heard him at the
door. How did that noise surprise us! She hid me
behind the bed, then lets him in.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> I tremble for the poor young lady.&mdash;Pray go
on. How did she recover herself?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> She fell into the prettiest artful little tales to
divert him and hide her discomposure&mdash;which he interrupted
by telling her she must be married suddenly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
one proposed to him that evening. This was to me
daggers.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> But she!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> She, by general answers, in that case managed
it so well that he was going down, when instantly my
watch in my pocket struck ten. He turns him short on
his amazed daughter, asked where she had it. She cried
her cousin Martha sent it out of the country to be
mended for her. He said he would take care on't. She
comes to me, but as I was giving it her the string was
so entangled in the cock of a pistol I always had about
me on those occasions, that my haste to disengage it fired
it off. My mistress swoons away. The father ran out,
crying out murder. I thought her dead, feared his
return, which he soon did with two boisterous rogues, his
sons, and his whole family of servants. I would have
made my escape, but they opposed me with drawn
swords. I wounded both; but a lusty wench, with a
fireshovel, at one blow struck down my sword, and broke
it all to pieces.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> But still, the poor young lady!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Here was I seized. Meantime, Matilda wakes
from her trance, beholding me held like a ruffian, both
her brothers bleeding. She was returning to it. What
should I do? I saw the hoary father in the divided
sorrow, for his sons' lives and daughter's honour, of both
which he thought me the invader. She, with pitying,
dying and reproaching looks, beseeched me, and taught me
what I owed her constant love. I yielded, sir, I own I
yielded to the just terror of their family resentment, and
to my mistress's more dreadful upbraiding. Thus am
I, sir, the martyr of an honest passion&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> That I most blame is, that you concealed it
from your best friend. I'll instantly to Penelope's
father, and make my apology. He is my friend.
[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> This marriage strangely surprised me.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Why, did you believe it, too, as well as the
old gentleman? Why, then, I did it excellently. Ha!
ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> What,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> the watch! The pistol! Lady swooning!
Her pitying, upbraiding look! All chimera?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Nothing but downright wit, to keep myself
safe for Victoria.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> May I desire one favour?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> What can I deny thee, my privado?</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Only that you'd give me some little secret hint
when next you l&mdash;&mdash;are going to be witty. But to
jumble particulars so readily! 'Tis impossible you could,
I believe, at the beginning of your tale know the ending&mdash;Yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> These are gifts, child, mere gifts; 'tis not to
be learnt&mdash;the skill of lying&mdash;except humour, wit, invention,
presence of mind, retention, memory, circumspection,
etc., were to be obtained by industry. You must
not hum, nor haw, nor blush for't&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Who have we got here?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> <i>entering.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Bet.</i> May I be so bold as to crave the liberty to ask
your name?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> My bright handmaid, my little she Ganymede&mdash;thou
charming Hebe&mdash;you may ask me my
name, for I won't tell it you&mdash;till you do; because I'd
have the more words with you.</p>

<p><i>Bet.</i> Are not you Mr. Bookwit?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> The very same, my dear.</p>

<p>Oh, the happiness! What is become of the girl? Oh!
Latine! Latine! ask me fifty questions all at once!
What ails me? Why this joy? Who is this from? Oh,
I could die, methinks, this moment, lest there should be
in fate some future ill to dash my present joy! Why,
Jack, why dost not ask me what's the matter?</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> If you'd but give me leave&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> No; do not speak. Let me talk all; I fain
would celebrate my fair one's praise, her every beauty!
but the mind's too full to utter anything that is articulate,
and will give way to nothing but mere names and interjections.
O Victoria! Victoria! Victoria! O my Victoria!
Read there.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Well, I own this subscribed "Victoria"&mdash;but still
I am afraid of mistakes.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> No&mdash;kneel down and ask forgiveness. You
don't believe that she that would not speak to me would
write.&mdash;But after all raptures and ecstasies&mdash;prithee step
after the maid, learn what you can of her fortune, and
so forth. Get interest to be admitted another time.

mortal enemy. With your sword I expect satisfaction to-morrow

I will be very punctual. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Fred.</span>]&mdash;I fall into

there's anything in that old whim of being wrapt in one's
mother's smock to be thus lucky; I suppose I was used
like other children. They clapped me on a skull-cap,
swathed me hard, played me in arms, and shewed me
London. But however it comes about I have strange
luck with the women.</p>

<h3>ACT THE THIRD.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Victoria's</span> <i>Lodgings, Covent Garden.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Victoria</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Betty</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Vict.</i> This was, indeed, Betty, a very
diverting accident, that I should be
employed to write to her lover. Now,
I can't but think how angry my
cousin Pen is. She frets, I warrant,
at her very looking-glass, which used to
be her comforter upon all occasions.</p>

<p><i>Bet.</i> I would not be in poor Mrs. Lettice's place for
all the world. Nothing, to be sure, can please to-day;
did you mind how she nestled and fumed inwardly to see
your ladyship look so well? Nay, indeed, madam,
you were in high beauty.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Yet I must confess I was myself a little discomposed.
I was ashamed for my friend, and then to
see her show such a regard for a fellow!</p>

<p><i>Bet.</i> But I swear, were I to have my will, you should
be always angry at me. It gives your ladyship such a
pretty fierceness, and quick spirit to your features&mdash;not
that you want it&mdash;yet it adds&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> There are some people very unhappily pretend
to fire and life; there's poor, stupid, insipid Lady Fad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
has heard of the word spleen, and distaste, and sets up
for being out of humour, with that unmeaning face of
hers.</p>

<p><i>Bet.</i> You're in a fine humour, madam.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Her ladyship's physician prescribed anger to her;
upon which she comes in public with her eyes staringly
open. This she designs for vivacity, and gapes about
like a wandering country lady. She pretends to be a
remarker, and looks at everybody; but, alas, she wants
it here, and knows not that to see, is no more to look,
than to go is to walk. For you must know, Betty,
every child can see, but 'tis an observing creature that
can look; as every pretty girl can go, but 'tis a fine
woman that walks.</p>

<p><i>Both.</i> Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> But, by the way, there's Mrs. Penelope, methinks,
does neither; I have a kindness for her, but she
has no gesture in the least. My dear&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Penelope</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Well, my dear&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bet.</i> How civilly people of quality hate one another.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Well, my dear, were not you strangely surprised
to see that this young Bookwit should be the soldier
we met this morning?</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> The confident lying creature! Indeed, I
wondered you'd suffer him to entertain you so long.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> You must know, madam, he's married too at
Oxford.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> The ugly wretch! I think him downright disagreeable.&mdash;But
perhaps this is a fetch of hers; he had
no married look. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Yet I am resolved to go to your assignation, if it
be but to confront the coxcomb, and laugh at his lie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Such fellows should be made to know themselves, and
that they're understood.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> I'll wait upon you, my dear.&mdash;She's very prettily
dressed. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;But indeed, my dear, you shan't go
with your hood so; it makes you look abominably,
with your head so forward. There&mdash;[<i>Displacing her
head</i>]; that's something. You had a fearful, silly
blushing look; now you command all hearts.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Thank you, my dear.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Your servant, dearest.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> But alas, madam, who patched you to-day? Let
me see. It is the hardest thing in dress&mdash;I may say,
without vanity, I know a little of it. That so low on the
cheek pulps the flesh too much. Hold still, my dear,
I'll place it just by your eye.&mdash;Now she downright
squints. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> There's nothing like a sincere friend, for one
is not a judge of one's self. I have a patch-box about
me. Hold, my dear, that gives you a sedate air, that
large one near your temples.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> People, perhaps, don't mind these things. But
if it be true, as the poet finely sings, that "all the passions
in the features are," we may show or hide
'em, as we know how to affix these pretty artificial
moles&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> And so catch lovers, and puzzle physiognomy.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> 'Tis true; then pray, my dear, let me put a little
disdain in your face: for we'll plague this fop. There&mdash;that
on your forehead does it.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Hold, my dear; I'll give indifference for him, a
patch just at the point of your lip exactly shows it&mdash;and
that you're dumb to all applications.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> You wish I would be. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> There, my dear.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> But, dear madam, your hair is not half powdered.
Betty, bring the powder-box to your lady. It gives one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
a clean look (though your complexion does not want it)
to enliven it.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Oh! fie, this from you! But I know you won't
flatter me, you're too much my friend.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Now, madam, you shall see. [<i>Powders her.</i>]&mdash;Now
she looks like a sprite. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Thank you, my dear; we'll take an hack. Our
maids shall go with us. Come, dear friend.
[<i>Exeunt arm in arm.</i></p>

<p><i>Bet.</i> Pray, Madam Lettice, be pleased to go on.</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> Indeed, Madam Betty, I must beg your
pardon.</p>

<p><i>Bet.</i> I am at home, dear Madam Lettice.</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> Well, madam, this is unkind. I don't use you
with this ceremony. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

question but in a little time I shall be a finer fop than
the town has yet seen. All my lackeys shall be linguists
as thou art. While thus I ride immortal steeds&mdash;how
my horses stare at me! They see I am a very new sort
of beau.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> This is rare&mdash;the having this noise of music. But
won't it be reckoned a disturbance?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> No, no; it is a usual gallantry here. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the vocal is an elegance hardly known before me here&mdash;who
am the founder of accomplished fools, of which I'll
institute an order. All coxcombs of learning and parts
shall after me be called Bookwits&mdash;a sect will soon be
more numerous, and in more credit, than your Aristotelians,
Platonists, and Academics.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Sir, 'twill be extraordinary, and you are really a
wise person&mdash;you put your theory of philosophy into
practice; 'tis not with you a dead letter.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Oh! sir, no. The design of learning is for
the use of life; therefore I'll settle a family very suddenly,
and show my literature in economy.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> As how, pray?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> I'll have four peripatetic footmen, two
followers of Aristippus for valets de chambre, and an
epicurean cook&mdash;with an hermetical chemist (who are
good only at making fires) for my scullion; and then I
think all is disposed. But, methinks this fair one takes
state upon her. But I am none of your languishers; I
am not known in town, and if I misbehave, 'tis but being
sent back again to my small beer and three-halfpenny
commons; and I, like many another beau, only blazed
and vanished&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> But you know I love music immoderately. How
do you dispose your entertainment? Let 'em begin.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Well, give me but leave. The fiddles will
certainly attract the ladies, I mean the nymphs who have
grottos round this enchanted forest. In the first place,
you intelligences that move this vehicle&mdash;how the fellows
stare!</p>

<p><i>Chair.</i> Good your honour, speak to us in English.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Why then, you chairmen, wherever I move,
you are to follow me; for I mean to strut, shine through
the dusk of the evening, and look as like a lazy town-fool
as I can, to charm 'em.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Well, but the music?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> But remember, ye sons of Phœbus, brethren
of the string and lyre, that is to say, ye fiddlers&mdash;Let me
have a flourish as I now direct. When I lift up my cane,
let it be martial. If I but throw myself just forward on
it, or but raise it smoothly, sigh all for love, to show, as I
think fit, that I would die or fight for her you see me bow
to. Well, then, strike up:&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> There's for you, Jack; is not that like a fine
gentleman that writes for his own diversion?</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> And nobody's else.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Now I warrant one of your common sparks
would have stamped, fretted, and cried, what the devil!
fooled! jilted! abused!&mdash;while I, in metre, to show you
how well nothing at all may be made to run&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> I begin to be one of those savages.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Victoria, Penelope, Lettice</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Betty</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Vict.</i> We had better have stayed where we were, and
listened to that charming echo, than have come in search
of that liar.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Do you see yonder?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> [<i>Gives the sign and sings himself.</i>] Thus,
madam, have I spent my time almost ever since I saw
you, repeated your name to the woods, the dales, and
echoing groves.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Prithee observe him. Now he begins.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> I had not time to carve your name on every
tree, but that's a melancholy employment, not for those
lovers that are favoured with assignation.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Prithee, cousin, do you talk to him in my name.
I'll be silent till I see farther.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> The spring is now so forward, that it must indeed
be attributed to your passion that you are not in the
field.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> You do me justice, madam, in that thought,
for I am strangely pestered to be there. Well, the French
are the most industrious people in the world. I had a
letter from one of their generals, that shall be nameless
(it came over by the way of Holland), with an offer of
very great terms, if I would but barely send my opinion
in the use of pikes, about which he tells me their Prince
and generals have lately held a grand court martial.</p>

<p><i>Both.</i> Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> These cunning things keep still together to puzzle
us.&mdash;I'll alarm him.&mdash;Sir, one word&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Come, come, we'll have no whispering, no messages
at present. Some other ladies have sent, but they
shan't have you from us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Both.</i> Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> I hold myself obliged to be of the same
humour ladies are in&mdash;ha! ha! ha! Now pray do me
the favour to tell me what I laughed at.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i><a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Why, you must know, your talking of the French
and war put us in mind of a young coxcomb that came
last night from Oxford, calls himself soldier, treats ladies,
fights battles, raises jealousies with downright lies of his
own inventing&mdash;ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> That must be an impudent young rascal
certainly&mdash;ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Nay, this is beyond comparison&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> I can't conceive how one of those sneaking
academics could personate such a character; for we, bred
in camps, have a behaviour that shows we are used to act
before crowds.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> 'Tis certainly so; nay, he has been confronted
with it, as plainly as I speak to you, and yet not
blushed for it, but carried it as if he knew not the
man&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> That may be; 'tis want of knowing themselves
makes those coxcombs so confident.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> The faithless! shameless! Well, then, to see, if
possible, such a one may be brought to that sense, I tell
you, this worthy hero two days ago was in hanging-sleeves
at Oxford, and is called Mr. Bookwit. Ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Well, was it not well enough carried? Pooh,
I knew you well enough, and you knew me, before you
writ to me for Mr. Bookwit's son. But I fell into that way of
talking purely to divert you. I knew you a woman of wit
and spirit, and that acting that part would at least show I
had fire in me, and wished myself what I would be half
an age to serve and please you&mdash;suffer in camps all the
vicissitudes of burning heats and sharp afflicting colds&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Look you, sir, I shall tell Mrs. Matilda Newtown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
your spouse at Oxford, what you are saying to another
lady.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Prithee cousin, never give yourself the trouble
to meddle in such a work; one hardly knows how to
speak it to a gentleman, but don't touch the affairs of so
impudent a liar.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;Why, madam, have they
told you of the marriage too? Well, I was hard put to
it there. I had like to have been gravelled, faith. You
were more beholden to me for that than anything. Had
it not been for that, they had married me to Mrs. Penelope,
old Getwel's granddaughter, the great fortune; but
I refused her for you&mdash;who are a greater. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Sir! sir! pray sir, one word&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pen. and Vict.</i> Stand off, sirrah.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> You shan't come near him; none of your dumb
signs.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Then you have refused Penelope, though a great
fortune! What could you dislike in her?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> The whole woman. Her person, nor carriage
please me. She is one of those women of condition,
who do and say what they please with an assured air, and
think that's enough, only to be called fine mistress such-a-one's
manner.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> This is not to be endured.&mdash;I do assure you, sir,
Mrs. Penelope has refused your betters.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> I don't much value my betters in her judgment,
but am sorry to see you concerned for her. When
I have been at church, where I first saw you, I've seen
the gay giddy thing in a gallery watching eyes to make
curtsies. She is indeed a very ceremonious churchwoman,
and never is guilty of a sin of omission to any lady of
quality within eye-shot. In short, I don't like the
woman, and would go to Tunis or Aleppo for a wife
before I'd take her.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> I cannot bear this of my friend; if you go on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
sir, at this rate, Tunis or Aleppo are the properest
places for you to show your gallantry in; 'twill never
be received by any here&mdash;I hope she believes me.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> The lady's in the right on't; who can confide in
a known common impostor?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i><a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Ah, madam! how can you use a man that
loves you so unjustly? But call me what you will, liar,
cheat, impostor&mdash;do but add, your servant, and I am
satisfied. I have, indeed, madam, ran through many
shifts in hopes to gain you, and could be contented to
run through all the shapes in Ovid's Metamorphoses, could
I but return to this on my bended knees, of my fair one's
humble servant.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Prithee let us leave him, as you told me; I
wonder you can suffer him to entertain you so long.
Leave him, let him kneel to the trees and call to the woods
if he will.&mdash;Oh, I could brain him&mdash;how ugly he looks
kneeling to her! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> No, I'll stay to plague him more.&mdash;But what
opinion can I have of this sudden passion? You hardly
know me, I believe, or my circumstances?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> No, no, not I; I don't know you. Your
mother was not Alderman Sterling's daughter; your
father, Mr. Philips, of Gray's Inn, who had an estate
and never practised? You had not a brother killed at
Landen? Your sister Diana is not dead? nor you are
not co-heiress with Miss Molly? No, madam, I don't
know you; no, nor love you.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> I wish I had taken her advice in going; he means
her all this while [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Pshaw, this is downright
fooling. Let's go, my dear; leave him to the woods, as
you say&mdash;I wish 'twas full of bears. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> No; now I'll stay to plague him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> No, you shan't stay.&mdash;Sir, we have given ourselves
the diversion to see you, and confront you in your falsehoods;
in which you have entangled yourself to that
degree, you know not even the woman you pretend to;
and therefore, sir, I so far despise you, that if you should
come after me with your fiddles, I'll have a porter&mdash;ready
to let you in. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> I don't know how to threaten a gentleman in that
manner, but I'm sure I shall never entertain any man
that has disobliged my friend, while my name's Victoria!
[<i>Exeunt arm in arm.</i></p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Master, methinks these ladies don't understand
wit. They were very rough with you.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Ay, they were somewhat dull. But really
Victoria discovered herself at her going, methinks,
agreeably enough.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> I believe they are irrecoverably lost. Pox on't,
when I gave you so many signs, too.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Well, hang thinking. Let's to the tavern,
and in every glass name a new beauty, till I either
forget, or am inspired with some new project to attain
her.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">While in a lovely bowl I drown my care,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She'll cease to be, or I to think her, fair. [<i>Exeunt.</i></span><br />

<h3>ACT THE FOURTH.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>Covent Garden.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Young Bookwit</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Latine</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Young Book.</i> This Roebuck has
almost done my business. Rigby's an
honest fellow, and would not poison
us. The wine had good-humour,
mirth, and joy in it. My blood beats
high and frolic. What says my dear
lackey? Ha!</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Why, sir, I say, sir, that I am in so noble, so
exalted a condition, that I almost forget I am your
honour's footman.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Do but your business well to-night.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Who says the tongue stutters, legs falter, and eyes
fail with drink? 'Tis false, my dear master, my tongue
runs faster than ever; my legs so brisk and nimble, that
I can't stand still; and my eyes are better than ever they
were; for I see everything double&mdash;But the letter, the
letter, I warrant I give it her.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Here, here, Jack, take it.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Let's come nearer the lamp. This is the foul
copy of it that 'tis wrapped in. Let me judge. Now
I'll be sedate. Let me read it again.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> But you look cursedly fluttered; they'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
say you're drunk. Let's see, I must comb your wig a
little.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> I shall be kicked for this letter here about the
middle. You should not talk of joys so soon; you
should write miserable a fortnight or three weeks longer&mdash;I
shall be kicked.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> What then? what then? A man of your
philosophy must needs remember, the body's but the
mere organ of the mind. Kicks come under the topic
of things without. What shall I do for powder for this
smart bob? [<i>Combs out his own wig into</i> <span class="smcap">Lat's</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> 'Tis no matter, sir; powder comes under the
notion of things without.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Oh! but ladies are no philosophers; but as
to being drubbed (these stockings too), you must fix your
imagination upon some other object, and you may, by
force of thought, suspend your feeling. The body is but
the instrument of the mind, and you may command an
instrument.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> No, sir, I'll have you to know, I'll save my carcass
by mere dint of eloquence. You have no other
orders?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> No; but may persuasion, grace, and elocution
hang on thy lips. But if you can come in to Victoria,
she and the wine you've drank will inspire you.
Farewell. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> This is the enchanted castle which the lady fair
inhabits. Ha! Mr. Simon, sir, I am your most humble
servant. My dear friend&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Simon</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sim.</i> Your servant, good sir; my lady is with Madam
Victoria at cards. She'll lie here to-night&mdash;but all's
ruined; they are both huge angry with your master.
But Lettice, having taken a fancy to you, Mr. John,
spoke up rarely, that she did indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Can't one come to the speech of her?</p>

<p><i>Sim.</i> I was ordered to have a strict eye to the door,
and let nobody in whatever. I don't care for going up,
because she'll see I have made a cap of one of the finest
napkins, for which she'll make a plaguy noise.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Nay, nay, you are exactly of my mind; I love to
avoid anger.</p>

<p><i>Sim.</i> You are a little disguised in drink, though, Mr.
John&mdash;but I ain't seen you, not I. Go straight up: Mrs.
Lettice is in the ante-chamber.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> I thank you, dear friend. My master bids me
upon these occasions&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Gives him money.</i></p>

<p><i>Sim.</i> I beg your pardon, good Mr. John.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Look you, I am a servant as well as you; what
do you mean, Mr. Simon? Come, come, time's precious.
When your lady's married, all these vails will end.</p>

<p><i>Sim.</i> Nay, I said behind your back, Mr. John, that
you were very well spoken. Well, put up briskly. I'll
stand your friend as much as one servant can to another,
against all masters and mistresses whatever.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Thanks, good Mr. Simon. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Penelope's</span> <i>Lodgings.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Lettice</span>, <i>discovered reading, by a small candle; two large
ones by her unlighted.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lett.</i> 'Tis a most sad thing, one dare not light a large
candle except company's coming in, and I scarce can see
to read this piteous story. Well, in all these distresses
and misfortunes, the faithful Argalus was renowned all
over the plains of Arca&mdash;Arca&mdash;Arcadia&mdash;for his loyal
and true affection to his charming paramour, Parthenia.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Blessings on his heart for it; there are no such suitors
nowadays. [<i>Weeping.</i>] But I hope they'll come together
again at the end of the book, and marry, and have
several children. Oh! Bless me! A man here! [<i>Turns
over the leaves.</i>]&mdash;The gentleman's pretty man&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Latine</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>I wonder by what means, with that impudence, you could
offer to come upstairs at this time of the night, and my
lady in the next room. I protest I'll cry out.
[<i>In a low voice all.</i></p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Dear Mrs. Lettice, my love to you. [<i>Aloud.</i></p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> Hist, hist! I am, methinks, however, loth to
discover you, because servants must do as they're bid;
for I know it was not to see me, but some message from
your master you came about.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> I offered to bring a letter from him, in hopes to
see you, my dearest. I'll not give it at all; I don't care,
my dearest. [<i>Kisses her hand.</i></p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> Pho! pho! now you are rude, because you know
one dare not discover you. You do what you will.&mdash;How
he kisses one's hand: I warrant he has kissed his betters.
[<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Pray, did you never live in a lady's service?</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> No; nor do I value any of the sex but your dear
self, Mrs. Lettice.&mdash;I would be discovered. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;I'm
in a rapture! in a flame!</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> [<i>Within.</i>] Who's there?</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> Hist, hist! could not you have forced a kiss
quietly?&mdash;Madam! madam!&mdash;Hold me fast. Show the
letter, my lady's coming.&mdash;I tell you, sir, she will receive
no message at all. Get you downstairs, you impudent!&mdash;Hold
me faster yet; she loves your master.
[<i>Softly aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Latine</span>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Penelope</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Victoria</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Pen.</i> What can this mean? What fellow's that has
seized the wench?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> Madam, madam, here's Mr. Bookwit's footman
drunk, and has directly stole upstairs with some ill design,
I fear, on me&mdash;but has a letter from his master to
your ladyship.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Call up the servants: Simon, William, Kate, Alf!
I'll have the rascal well basted for his insolence&mdash;served
just as his master deserves.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> [<i>Kneeling.</i>] Let not those lips, more sweet than
labour of Hyblæan bees, utter a sentence, as if a Libyan
lioness on a mountain gave thee suck, and thou wert the
obdurate offspring of a rock.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Hyblæan! Libyan! Obdurate! Ridiculous.
The fellow has got his master's cant! Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> I'll put him out of it, I'll warrant you. What,
will no one come up there?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> Servants <i>with brooms, &amp;c.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Oh! for the force of eloquence to allay and
reconcile the passion of this angry mansion!&mdash;I had like
to have said plain house, which had been against the laws
of buskin, in which I would at present talk. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Did you ever hear anything like this? Ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Madam, shall I beat him?</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Ah! culinary fair, compose thy rage; thou whose
more skilful hand is still employed in offices for the
support of nature, descend not from thyself, thou bright
cookmaid&mdash;&mdash;There! sunk again! [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;With
heightened gusts and quickening tastes, by you what
would be labour else is made delight. Thou great robust,
let not thy hand all red assault a life it rather should
preserve.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Good madam, excuse me, I can't touch him&mdash;&mdash;I
have bowels for him. [<i>Weeping.</i></p>

<p><i>Sim.</i> I wish I had his learning. I'll warrant he buys in
everything wherever he lives.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> This, madam, this faithful paper tells you the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
passions of the tenderest heart that ever bled for cruel
maid. Oh, Victoria! did you but hear his sighs, his
restless hours!&mdash;how often he repeats Victoria!</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> Victoria! Then I find this is none on't meant to
my lady&mdash;nor to me neither; the master and man are
both rogues. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Receive your seasonable epistle now at midnight!</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> He can't mean me&mdash;&mdash;To you he all along
addressed.&mdash;Would I could read it without her. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> To show you I value neither author nor bearer of
it&mdash;kick the fellow down!</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Nay, madam, since matters must come to extremities,
I'd rather have the honour of your ladyship's
command to be cudgelled by your good family than have
it from my master. A disappointed lover in his rage will
strike stone walls and things inanimate, much more a
poor live footman; therefore I must deliver my message.
I'll read it to you, ladies, for I see you are friends.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Away with him.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> "If the sincerity of my intentions were not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Lett.</i> Get out, false wretch.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> "Demonstrable, in spite of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Take that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<i>Covent Garden.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lovemore</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Frederick</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Love.</i> It is so pleasant a night that I will see you over
the Garden to your lodgings.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> That compliment won't pass upon me. Your
reason for sauntering this way is that 'tis near Penelope's.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> I come for her sake! No; should she write,
beseech, kneel to me, I think I ne'er should value her
more. No, I'll be no longer her tool, her jest; she shall
not dally with a passion she deserves not.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> 'Twere very well were this resolution in your
power; but believe me, friend, one smile, one glance
that were but doubtful whether favourable, would conquer
all your indignation.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Faith, I'm afraid what you say is true.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Then strive not to be rationally mad, which
you attempt if you think you can at once be at your own
command and at another's. Would you be master of
yourself and have a mistress?</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> But I can rebel against that mistress.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Do if you can. Nay, I'm sure 'tis in your power,
because to-morrow morning you are to fight a rival for
her&mdash;because though you know she lies backwards, and
you can't so much as see her chamber window, you
must needs walk hither. Well, I protest I'm of your
mind; there is, me thinks, now a particular, amiable gloom
about that house&mdash;though, perhaps, to ordinary beholders
it is exactly like the others.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> You are very witty, I must confess, at your
friend's follies, Mr. Frederick.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I won't then any longer disturb your meditation,
but e'en go home like a dull rogue as I am, and without
love enough to any woman, or hatred enough to any man,
to keep me awake, fall fast asleep&mdash;I was going to wish
you rest, but you are above all that. If it should rain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
I'd advise you not to forget it does, but go into the
Piazza. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Love.</i> 'Tis very well, I'm deservedly laughed at. But
the door opens&mdash;Bookwit's footman! [<span class="smcap">Latine</span> <i>crosses
the stage.</i>] The master, I suppose, is there too. I'll
watch for his coming out&mdash;&mdash;The morning approaches
too slowly. He shall not sleep to-night except it be for
ever&mdash;&mdash;Oh, revenge! Oh, jealousy!</p>

<p>I wonder what's become of poor Latine. I wish he had
a bumper of this&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Drinks.</i></p>

<p><i>Love.</i> I have no patience to observe his insolent
jollity; how immoderately joyful my misery has made
him!&mdash;Bookwit!</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Lovemore!</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> What, sir! are you diverting the thought of to-morrow
morning's business with midnight riot? Or is it
an assignation keeps you out of bed thus late?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> An hour or two till morning is not much in
either of our lives; therefore I must tell you now, sir,
I am ready for your message.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> I want no witnesses. I have a sword, as
you bid me meet you. [<i>They draw and fight.</i></p>

<p><i>Love.</i> You've done my business. [<i>Falls.</i></p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Then I've done what you desired me. But
this is no place for me. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Const.</i> Where, where was this clashing of swords?
So-ho! So-ho! You, sir, what, are you dead? Speak,
friend; what are you afraid of? If you are dead, the
law can't take hold of you.</p>

<p><i>Watch.</i> I beg your pardon, Mr. Constable, he ought
by the law to be carried to the Round-house for being
dead at this time of night.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> You well may be surprised at my waiting
here for your coming home. But you'll pardon me, since
it is to ease me of an anxiety that keeps me waking.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I shall be very glad if I am capable of doing
that.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i><a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> You knew my Tom at Oxford, and I believe
were not so hard a student, but you made some
acquaintance in the town&mdash;therefore, pray tell me, do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
you know Mr. Newtown there&mdash;his family, descent, and
fortune?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> What Newtown?</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> I'll tell you, sir, what you young fellows take
most notice of old ones for&mdash;a token that you needs must
know him by&mdash;he's the father of the fair Matilda, your
celebrated beauty of that town.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I assure you, sir, I never heard of the father or
daughter till this instant; therefore I'm confident there's
no such beauty.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> Oh, sir, I know your drift&mdash;you're tender of
informing me for my son's sake! He told me all himself.
I know all the progress of his love with the young
lady; how he was taken in the night in her bedchamber
by his pistol going off, the family disturbance that was
raised upon it, which he composed by marrying&mdash;I know
it all.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Is Tom Bookwit then married at Oxford?</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> He is, indeed, sir; therefore our affairs are
now so linked that 'twill be an ill office both to the Newtowns
and to us to conceal anything from me that relates
to them.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> A man can't be said to conceal what he does
not know&mdash;&mdash;But it seems it was Mr. Bookwit gave
you this account himself.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> Yes, sir; I told you, sir, I had it from himself.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Then I'm sure there was nothing left out; he
never tells a story by halves.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> Why, then, you think my son's a liar.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Oh fie, sir, but he enlivens a mere narration with
variety of accidents; to be plain, his discourse gains him
more applause than credit. You could not, I believe,
have married your son to a less expensive lady in England
than this Mrs. Matilda. I'll be sworn you'll avoid
all the charge of gay dress, high play, and stately childbirth.
You understand me, sir?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> I never could see anything in my son that's
disingenuous, to put his aged father to this shame.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Never fret or grieve for it. He told Lovemore
this morning such a relation of his feasting ladies, and I
know not what, that he has brought a tilt upon his hands
to-morrow morning; therefore keep him at home. I'll
to his adversary, so we'll convince him of a fault which
has so ill (though not intended) consequences.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> You'll highly oblige me, sir; I'll trouble you
no longer. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE IV.&mdash;<i>Newgate.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Young Bookwit, Latine, Simon, Storm</span>, <i>with the
crowd of Gaol-birds.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Storm.</i> I apprehend, sir, by Mr. Turnkey, the gentleman
there with a broken nose, that you're brought in for
murder. I honour you, sir; I don't question but 'twas
done like a gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> I hope it will appear so.</p>

<p><i>Storm.</i> I come, I fear, sir, to your acquaintance with
some prejudice, because you see me thus in irons. But
affliction is the portion of the virtuous and the gallant.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> It does not depress, sir, but manifest the
brave.</p>

<p><i>Storm.</i> Right, sir, I find you're noble. You may, perhaps,
have heard of me. My name is Storm. This
person, my friend, who is called Faggot, and myself,
being exposed by an ungrateful world to feel its cruelty
and contempt of ragged virtue, made war upon it, and in
open day infested their high road.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Your humble servant, gentlemen, I do conceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
you. Your spirits could not stoop to barter on the
change, to sneer in courts, to lie, to flatter, or to creep
for bread. You, therefore, chose rather to prey like
lions, then betray like crocodiles, or fawn like dogs. You
took upon you to interrupt the commerce of a cheating
world, to unload the usurer of his anxious pelf, and save
the thoughtless landed boy he travelled to undo, with a
thousand such good actions; by which means you two
are infamous, for what two millions of you had been
glorious.</p>

<p><i>Storm.</i> Right, sir; I see you're knowing, sir, and
learned in man. This gentleman, Mr. Charcoal, the
chemist, was our secret correspondent, and as we never
robbed a poor man, so he never cheated a fool, but still
imposed on your most sprightly wits and genius&mdash;fellows
of fire and metal, whose quick fancies and eager wishes
formed reasons for their undoing. He is a follower of
the great Raimundus Lullius; the public think to frighten
him into their own purposes. But he'll leave the ungrateful
world without the secret.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> You know, sir, he that first asserted the Antipodes
died for that knowledge; and I, sir, having found
out the melioration of metals, the ignorant will needs call
it coining; and I am to be hanged for it, would you
think it?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> When, pray sir, are you to be immortal?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> On Friday next. I'm very unhappy our
acquaintance is to be short. I'm very sorry your business
is not over, sir, that, if it must be, we might go
together.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> I'm highly obliged to you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Yet let me tell you, sir, because by secret sympathy
I'm yours, I must acquaint you, if you can obtain
the favour of an opportunity and a crucible, I can show
projection&mdash;directly Sol, sir, Sol, sir, more bright than
that high luminary the Latins called so&mdash;wealth shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
be yours; we'll turn each bar about us into golden ingots.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
Sir, can you lend me half-a-crown?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Oh, sir, a trifle between such old acquaintance.</p>

<p><i>Storm.</i> You'll be indicted, sir, to-morrow. I would
advise you, when your indictment's read, to one thing:
that is, don't cavil at false Latin; but if by chance there
should be a word of good, except to that, and puzzle the
whole court.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Sir, I'm obliged&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Storm.</i> I defy the world to say I ever did an ill thing;
I love my friend. But there is always some little trifle
given to prisoners they call garnish; we of the road are
above it, but o' t'other side of the house, silly rascals that
came voluntarily hither&mdash;&mdash;such as are in for fools,
signed their own mittimus, in being bound for others,&mdash;may
perhaps want it. I'll be your faithful almoner.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Oh, by all means, sir. [<i>Gives him money.</i></p>

<p><i>Storm.</i> Pray, sir, is that your footman?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> He is my friend, sir.</p>

<p><i>Storm.</i> Look you, sir, the only time to make use of a
friend is in extremity. Do you think you could not hang
him and save yourself? Sir, my service to you; your
own health.</p>

<p><i>1st Pris.</i> Captain, your health.
[<i>Gives it to the next prisoner.</i></p>

<p><i>2nd Pris.</i> Captain, your health.</p>

<p><i>Storm.</i> But perhaps the captain likes brandy better.
So-ho! brandy there. [<i>Drinks.</i>] But you don't, perhaps,
like these strong liquors. Cider, ho! [<i>Drinks to
him in it.</i>] Gentlemen all! But, captain, I see you don't
love cider neither. You and I will be for claret then.
Ay, marry! I knew this would please [<i>Drinks</i>] you.
[<i>Drinks again.</i>] Faith, we'll make an end on't; I'm
glad you like it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Turn.</i> I'm sorry, Captain Storm, to see you impose on
a gentleman, and put him to charge in his misfortune.
If a petty larceny fellow had done this&mdash;&mdash;but one of
the road!</p>

<p><i>Storm.</i> I beg your pardon, sir, I don't question but the
captain understands there is a fee to you for going to the
keeper's side. [<span class="smcap">Book.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Latine</span> <i>give him money.
Exeunt with</i> <span class="smcap">Turnkey, Simon</span> <i>following.</i>] Nay, nay, you
must stay here.</p>

<p><i>Sim.</i> Why, I am Simon, Madam Penelope's man.</p>

<p><i>Storm.</i> Then Madam Penelope's man must strip for
garnish.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Indeed, Master Simon, you must.</p>

<p><i>Sim.</i> Thieves! Thieves! Thieves!</p>

<p><i>Storm.</i> Thieves! Thieves! Why, you senseless dog,
do you think there's thieves in Newgate? Away with
him to the tap-house. [<i>Pushes him off.</i>] We'll drink
his coat off. Come, my little chemist, thou shalt transmute
this jacket into liquor; liquor that will make us
forget the evil day. And while day is ours, let us be
merry.</p>

<h3>ACT THE FIFTH.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>Newgate.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Young Bookwit</span> <i>discovered on a couch asleep</i>, <span class="smcap">Latine</span> <i>looking
on him.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Lat.</i> How quietly he rests! Oh that I could,<br />
By watching him, hanging thus over him,<br />
And, feeling all his care, protract his sleep!<br />
Oh, sleep! thou sweetest gift of Heaven to man,<br />
Still in thy downy arms embrace my friend,<br />
Nor loose him from his inexistent trance<br />
To sense of yesterday and pain of being;<br />
In thee oppressors soothe their angry brow,<br />
In thee the oppressed forget tyrannic power,<br />
In thee&mdash;&mdash;<br />
The wretch condemned is equal to his judge,<br />
And the sad lover to his cruel fair;<br />
Nay, all the shining glories men pursue,<br />
When thou art wanted, are but empty noise.<br />
Who then would court the pomp of guilty power,<br />
When the mind sickens at the weary show,<br />
And dies to temporary death for ease;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>When half our life's cessation of our being&mdash;&mdash;<br />
He wakes&mdash;&mdash;<br />
How do I pity that returning life,<br />
Which I could hazard thousand lives to save!<br />
</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> How heavily do I awake this morning! Oh,
this senseless drinking! To suffer a whole week's pain
for an hour's jollity! Methinks my senses are burning
round me. I have but interrupted hints of the last
night&mdash;&mdash;Ha! in a gaol! Oh, I remember, I remember.
Oh, Lovemore! Lovemore! I remember&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> You must have patience, and bear it like a man.</p>

<p>
<i>Y. Book.</i> Oh, whither shall I run to avoid myself?<br />
Why all these bars? These bolted iron gates?<br />
They're needless to secure me&mdash;&mdash;Here, here's my rack,<br />
My gaol, my torture&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Oh, I can't bear it. I cannot bear the rushing of new thoughts;<br />
Fancy expands my senses to distraction,<br />
And my soul stretches to that boundless space<br />
To which I've sent my wretched, wretched friend.<br />
Oh, Latine! Latine! Is all our mirth and humour come to this?<br />
Give me thy bosom, close in thy bosom hide me<br />
From thy eyes; I cannot bear their pity or reproach.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Dear Bookwit, how heartily I love you&mdash;I don't
know what to say. But pray have patience.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> If you can't bear my pain that's but communicated
by your pity, how shall I my proper inborn woe,
my wounded mind?</p>

<p>
<i>Lat.</i> In all assaults of fortune that should be serene,<br />
Not in the power of accident or chance&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Y. Book.</i> Words! words! all that is but mere talk.<br />
Perhaps, indeed, to undeserved affliction<br />
Reason and argument may give relief,<br />
Or in the known vicissitudes of life<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>We may feel comfort by our self-persuasion;<br />
But oh! there is no taking away guilt:<br />
This divine particle will ache for ever.<br />
There is no help but whence I dare not ask;<br />
When this material organ's indisposed<br />
Juleps can cool and anodynes give rest;<br />
But nothing mix with this celestial drop,<br />
But dew from that high Heaven of which 'tis part.<br />
<br />
<i>Lat.</i> May that high Heaven compose your mind,<br />
And reconcile you to yourself.<br />
<br />
<i>Y. Book.</i> How can I hope it?<br />
No&mdash;&mdash;I must descend from man,<br />
Grovel on earth, nor dare look up again!<br />
Oh, Lovemore! Lovemore! Where is he now?<br />
Oh, thinking, thinking, why didst thou not come sooner?<br />
Or not now!&mdash;&mdash;<br />
My thoughts do so confuse me now&mdash;as my folly
and pleasures did before this fatal accident&mdash;that I cannot
recollect whence Lovemore was provoked to challenge
me.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> You know, dear Bookwit, I feared some ill from
a careless way of talking. But alas! I dreamt not of so
great&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Ay, there it was; he was naturally a little
jealous. Heavens, do I say he was? I talked to him
of ladies, treats, and he might possibly believe 'twas
where he had engaged&mdash;&mdash;I remember his serious
behaviour on that subject. Oh, this unhappy tongue of
mine!<br />
Thou lawless, voluble, destroying foe,<br />
That still run'st on, nor wait'st command of reason,<br />
Oh, I could tear thee from me&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Did you not expostulate before the action?</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> He would have don't; but I, flushed with
the thoughts of duelling, pressed on&mdash;&mdash;Thus for the
empty praise of fools, I'm solidly unhappy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> You take it too deeply. Your honour was concerned.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Honour! The horrid application of that
sacred word to a revenge against friendship, law, and
reason is a damned last shift of the damned envious foe
of human race. The routed fiend projected this, but
since the expansive glorious law from Heaven came down&mdash;&mdash;Forgive.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Mankind is infinitely beholden to this noble
styptic, that could produce such wonderful effects so
suddenly. But though my wound was very slight, I'm
weak by the effusion of so much blood.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Yet after all, you have not lost enough to cool
your passion. Your heart still beats, Penelope, Penelope&mdash;&mdash;But
in this disguise you have opportunity for
observation. You'll see whether you ought still to value
her or not. I'm glad you thought of being brought
hither as soon as you came to yourself. I expect old
Bookwit every moment here&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>There he is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> Oh, Mr. Frederick! too late, too late was
our care; they met last night, and then the fatal act was
done. You'll excuse, sir, a father's sorrow&mdash;&mdash;I can't
speak much, but you may guess what I hope from
you.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> You may depend upon ingenuous usage in the
prosecution. I'm going instantly to Penelope's with this
learned gentleman, to know what she can say to this
matter. I desired you, in the note I sent you, to purchase
the favour of your son's being brought thither,
where he and you may be witnesses of what shall pass.
I seek not his blood, nor would neglect a justice to my
deceased friend.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> I believe my son and the rest are going
thither ere this; and I desire this worthy serjeant's
favour and advice, since we both mean the same thing&mdash;only
to act with honour, if his life may be saved.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> I'll do what's just to the deceased and the survivor.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> I'll leave you, but will take care to come in
just afore the criminals arrive. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Love.</i> The poor old gentleman! Prithee, let's go;
I long to see my lovely torment, Penelope.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I'll but leave word within. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Penelope's</span> <i>Lodgings.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Penelope</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Victoria</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Pen.</i> It seems Simon lay out all night, and was carried
away by the watch with some gentlemen in a quarrel.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> I fancy the men who are always for showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
their valour are like the women who are always talking
of their chastity, because they are conscious of their
defect in it.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Right; for we are not apt to raise arguments but
about what we think is disputable.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Ay, ay, they whose honour is a sore part are
more fearful of being touched than they in whom 'tis only
a tender one. But tell me honestly, Penelope, should
poor Lovemore be in this rencounter, and that for your
sake, would it have no effect upon you in his favour?</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> I don't know how to answer you; but I find
something in that reflection which acquaints me 'tis very
hard for one to know one's own heart. [<i>Sighs.</i></p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> However, let your heart answer me one question
more, as well as it can. Does it love me as well as ever
it did?</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Does not, madam, that question proceed from a
change in your own?</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> It does, Penelope; I own it does&mdash;&mdash;I had
a long conflict with myself on my pillow last night.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> What were your thoughts there?</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> That I owed it to our friendship to acknowledge
to you that all the pleasure I once had in you is vanished.
Ah, Penelope! I'm sorry for every good quality you
have.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Since you are so frank, I must confess to you
something very like this. But however I envied that
sprightly, ingenuous, native beauty of yours, I see it now
so much the figure of your mind that I can conquer,
I think I can, any inclination in myself that opposes the
happiness of so sincere a friend.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> Explain yourself, my dear.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> I'll discountenance this Bookwit's ambiguous
addresses; and if Lovemore can forgive my late ill-usage&mdash;&mdash;I
need say no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Serv.</i> Mr. Frederick below desires to see you on some
extraordinary business.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> I have not time, my dearest friend, to applaud
or thank you, but must run in&mdash;&mdash;He comes from
Lovemore&mdash;&mdash;remember. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Let him come up&mdash;&mdash;Now can't I for my life
forbear a little tyranny.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Frederick</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lovemore</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Good morrow, sir. I believe I know your business:
you're officious for your friend&mdash;&mdash;But I am deaf.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I know you are, and have been; but I come
only to do him a last office. He'll trouble you no more,
but I must conjure you to read this, and inform this
learned gentleman what you know of this misfortune.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> [<i>Reading.</i>] "Your cruelty provoked me to desire
the favour of dying by Mr. Bookwit's hand, since he had
taken from me more than life in robbing me of you&mdash;&mdash;farewell
for ever&mdash;&mdash;I direct Frederick not to give you
this till I am no more." Writ in his blood! "Till I
am no more!" Lovemore no more! Thou shalt not be
no more&mdash;&mdash;thou shalt live here for ever. Here,
thou dearest paper, mingle with my life's stream; either
the paper bleeds anew, or my eyes weep blood. So let
'em do forever&mdash;&mdash;Oh, my Lovemore! did the vanity
of a prating boy banish thy solid services and manly
love?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> This is no reparation to him for his lost life,
nor me for my lost friend. Yet when you please to
receive 'em, I am obliged to deliver you some papers,
wherein he has given you all the fortune he could bestow,
nor would revoke it, even thus injured as he was.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Curse on all wealth and fortune! He&mdash;he is
gone who only deserved all, and whose worth I know
too late!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Love.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Fred.</span>] Oh, ecstasy! Why was I angry at
her rejoicing at my sorrow, when hers to me is such
a perfect bliss? 'Tis barbarous not to discover myself.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Love.</span>] Do, and be used barbarously&mdash;&mdash;But,
madam, you must be composed. Your life, for
ought I know, is at stake; for there is no such thing as
accessories in murder; and it can be proved you knew
of Lovemore's threatening to fight Bookwit. You must
either take your trial yourself, or be Mr. Bookwit's
witness.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> I his witness! No, I'll swear anything to hang
him.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Ah, madam, you must consider yourself, however&mdash;&mdash;Pray,
sir, read her indictment to her.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> [<i>Reading.</i>] "That on the said third day of April
the said Penelope, of the parish of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields,
spinster, without fear before her eyes, but by the
instigation of the devil, and through an evil pride of
heart&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> 'Tis too true&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Weeping.</i></p>

<p><i>Love.</i> "Did contrive, abet, and consent to the death of
John Lovemore, Esq., of the age of twenty-eight years,
or thereabouts."</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I can't hear the mention of him without tears.
He was the sincerest friend.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> I think I have seen him. He was, I've heard, a
man of honesty, but of something a disagreeable make.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Oh, sir, you never saw him if you think so&mdash;&mdash;His
person was as free as his mind was honest, nor had
he imperfection, but his love of me. [<i>Weeps.</i></p>

<p><i>Love.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Fred.</span>] I tremble I shall disoblige her too
much.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Love.</span>] You shan't discover yourself, you shall
go through her soul, now 'tis moved on our side. Win
her now, or see my face no more; I'll not have my wine
spoiled every night with your recitals of love, and asking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
advice, though you never mean to take it, like a true
lover.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> When did that best of men expire, good Mr.
Frederick?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> This morning. But should I speak the manner?
With a faint, dying voice he called me to him. I went
in tenderness to take my long farewell. He, in a last
effort of nature, pressed me to his breast, and, with the
softest accent, sighed in death&mdash;"Penelope."</p>

<p>
<i>Pen.</i> Oh, the too generous man! Ungrateful I!<br />
Curses on him first flattered with his tongue,<br />
On her that first dissembled in her silence&mdash;&mdash;<br />
What miseries have they entailed on life<br />
To bring in fraud and diffidence of love!<br />
Simplicity's the dress of honest passion,<br />
Then why our arts, why to a man enamoured,<br />
That at her feet effuses all his soul,<br />
Must woman cold appear, false to herself and him?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Love.</span>] Do you see there? You'd have spoke
before she considered that.</p>

<p>
<i>Pen.</i> Oh, could I see him now, to press his livid lips,<br />
And call him back to life with my complaints,<br />
His eyes would glare upon my guilt with horror,<br />
That used to gloat and melt in love before me.<br />
Let mine for ever then be shut to joy,<br />
To all that's bright and valuable in man!<br />
I'll to his sacred ashes be a wife,<br />
And to his memory devote my life. [<i>Exit.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> This is worth dying for indeed. I'll follow her.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> No, you shan't; let her go in, throw herself
upon her bed, and hug, and call her pillow "Lovemore."
'Tis but what you've done a thousand times for her.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> That's true too.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Let her contemplate on the mischief of her
vanity. She shall lament till her glass is of our side&mdash;till
its pretty eyes be all blubbered; its heart must heave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
and pant with perfect anguish before 'twill feel the sorrow
of another's. Don't you know, pride, scorn, affectation,
and a whole train of ills must be sobbed away
before a great beauty's mortified to purpose?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Serv.</i> Old Mr. Bookwit enquires for you here, Mr.
Frederick.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Pray, let him come up.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Old Bookwit</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Love.</i> What's the matter? You seem more discomposed
than you were at Mr. Frederick's. Something
still new?</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> I saw the boy a-coming in a chair; he looks
so languid and distressed, poor lad! He has all his
mother's softness, by nature of the sweetest disposition.
Oh, gentlemen, you know not what it is to be a father!
To see my only child in that condition&mdash;&mdash;My grief
quickened at the sight of him. I thought I could have
patience till I saw him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Serv.</i> There are two or three in chairs desire admittance
by appointment.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> 'Tis right, sir.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Young Bookwit, Latine</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Gaoler</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh, my dear child! Oh, Tom! are all thy aged
father's hopes, then, come to this, that he can't see thee,
his only son, but guarded by a gaoler? Thy mother's
happy that lived not to see this day. Is all the nurture
that she gave thy infancy, the erudition she bequeathed
thy youth, thus answered? Oh, my son! my son! rise
and support thy father! I sink with tenderness, my
child; come to my arms while thou art mine.</p>

<p>
<i>Y. Book.</i> Oh, best of fathers!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>Let me not see your tears,<br />
Don't double my afflictions by your woe&mdash;&mdash;<br />
There's consolation when a friend laments us, but<br />
When a parent grieves, the anguish is too native,<br />
Too much our own to be called pity.<br />
Oh, sir, consider; I was born to die.<br />
'Tis but expanding thought, and life is nothing.<br />
Ages and generations pass away,<br />
And with resistless force, like waves o'er waves,<br />
Roll down the irrevocable stream of time<br />
Into the insatiate ocean for ever&mdash;&mdash;Thus we are gone.<br />
But the erroneous sense of man&mdash;'tis the lamented<br />
That's at rest, but the survivor mourns.<br />
All my sorrows vanish with that thought,<br />
But Heaven grant my aged father patience!<br />
<br />
<i>O. Book.</i> Oh, child! [<i>Turning away.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Y. Book.</i> Do not torment yourself, you shall promise not to grieve.<br />
What if they do upbraid you with my death?<br />
Consider, sir, in death that our relation ceases;<br />
Nor shall I want your care, or know your grief.<br />
It matters not whether by law, or nature, 'tis I die.<br />
What, won't my father hear me plead to him?<br />
Don't turn from me&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Yet don't look at me with your soul so full.<br />
<br />
<i>O. Book.</i> Oh, my child! my child! I could hear thee ever.<br />
'Twas that I loved thee that I turn away;<br />
To hear my son persuade me to resign him,<br />
I can't, I can't. The grief is insupportable.<br />
<br />
<i>Y. Book.</i> You make a coward of me with your anguish.<br />
I grow an infant, scarce can weep with silence;<br />
But let me keep some decency in my distress.<br />
<br />
<i>O. Book.</i> If we might be apart&mdash;<br />
[<i>Looking at the company.</i><br />
But that's too much to hope.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Gaol.</i> No, no, we'll leave you to yourselves. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> I have too much upon me, child, to speak&mdash;and,
indeed, have nothing to say, but to feed my eyes
upon thee e'er we part for ever, if tears would let me.
When you have slept in your cradle, I have waked for
you&mdash;and was it to this end! Oh, child, you've broke
your father's heart. [<i>Swoons.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Y. Book.</i> Good Heav'n forbid it&mdash;guard him and protect him.<br />
He faints, he's cold, he's gone; [<i>Running to him.</i><br />
He's gone, and with his last breath called me parricide.<br />
"You've broke your father's heart!" Oh, killing sound!<br />
I'm all contagion; to pity me is death:<br />
My griefs to all are mortal but myself.<br />
"You've broke your father's heart!" If I did so,<br />
Why thus serene in death, thou smiling clay?<br />
Why that calm aspect to thy murderer?<br />
Oh, big unutterable grief&mdash;&mdash;merciful Heaven!<br />
I don't deserve this ease of tears to melt<br />
With penitence&mdash;Oh, sweet, sweet remorse;<br />
Now all my powers give way<br />
To my just sorrow, for the best of fathers. [<i>Aloud.</i><br />
Thou venerable fountain of my life,<br />
Why don't I also die, derived from thee?<br />
Sure you are not gone&mdash;Is the way out of life<br />
Thus easy, which you so much feared in me?<br />
[<i>Takes him by the hand.</i><br />
Why stay I after? But I deserve to stay,<br />
To feel the quick remembrance of my follies.<br />
Yet if my sighs, my tears, my anguish can atone&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Frederick, Lovemore, Latine, Gaoler,
Victoria</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Penelope</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Fred.</i> What is the matter? What&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Behold this sight! I am the guilty wretch&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Keep aside a little, sir, he only swoons, I hope.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
I think he breathes&mdash;yes, he returns. You must compose
yourself.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Poor Bookwit! how utterly he seems distressed!</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> I will be calm&mdash;resign to Heaven&mdash;and hear
you patiently.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> You, sir, his favourite servant, pray speak
honestly the truth of what you know to this learned
gentleman, who is counsel in this case.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Sir, he is not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> Pray, sir, give the servant leave first.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Know, then, I am not what I seem, but a gentleman
of a plentiful fortune. I am thus dressed to carry
on such gay pursuits as should offer in this town. Not
to detain you, Mr. Bookwit sent me late last night with
a letter to one of these ladies. Coming from thence, as
I crossed, I saw Lovemore in the Garden. He stopped
me, and, after some questions concerning my message to
this house, to which he did not like my answers, he struck
me. We fought&mdash;I left him dead upon the spot; of
which this gentleman is guiltless.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> How! was it you, then, that killed Mr.
Lovemore?</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> 'Twas this unhappy hand gave him his death,
but so provoked&mdash;</p>

<p>
<i>Y. Book.</i> Who could believe that any pleasing passion<br />
Could touch a breast loaded with guilt like mine?<br />
But all my mind is seized with admiration<br />
Of thy stupendous friendship. What then&mdash;<br />
Could'st thou hold thy innocent hand up at a bar<br />
With felons, to save thy friend?<br />
How shall I chide or praise thy brave imposture?<br />
Ah, sir, believe him not! He cannot bear the loss of
me whom he o'ervalues; therefore with highest gallantry
he offers a benefit which 'twere the meanest baseness to
receive.<br />
But death's more welcome than a life so purchased.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> We all know you can talk, and gild things as you
please, but the lady's servant knows I was taken near the
body when you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Sir, do but hear me&mdash;[<i>Pushing away</i> <span class="smcap">Lat</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> I'll easily convince you&mdash;[<i>Pushing away</i> <span class="smcap">Book</span>.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Pray mind him not, his brain is touched&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> I am the man, he was not near the place&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> I can hold out no longer.&mdash;Lovemore still lives
to adore your noble friendship, and begs a share in't.
Be not amazed! but let me grasp you both, who, in an
age degenerate as this, have such transcendent virtue&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> Oh, Lovemore! Lovemore! how shall I
speak my joy at thy recovery&mdash;<br />
I fail beneath the too ecstatic pleasure.<br />
What help has human nature from its sorrows,<br />
When our relief itself is such a burthen?<br />
</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> Oh, the best burthen upon earth!&mdash;I beg
your pardon, sir&mdash;I never was so taken with a man in
my life at first sight. [<i>Kisses</i> <span class="smcap">Love</span>.] Let me be known
to you too. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lat</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> Sir, you do me honour.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> But you, ladies, are the first cause of the
many errors we have been in, and you only can extricate
us with satisfaction. Such is the force of beauty. The
wounds the sword gave this gentleman were slight, but
you've transfixed a vital and a noble part&mdash;his heart.
Had I known his pretences, I had not interposed for
my son.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Come, madam, no more of the cruel&mdash;go on,
Lovemore; o' my conscience, the man's afraid 'tis impudence
to be alive again. You see him now, madam; now
you may press his livid lips, and call him back to life
with your complaints.</p>

<p><i>Love.</i> I stand, methinks, on the brink of fate, in an
ambiguous interval of life, and doubt to accept of being
till you smile. In every human incident besides<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>I am superior, and can choose or leave;<br />
But in minutest things that touch my love,<br />
My bosom's seized with anguish or with transport.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> You've shown your passion to me with such
honour that if I am confused, I know I should not be,
to say I approve it; for I know no rules should make
me insensible of generous usage. My person and my
mind are yours for ever.</p>

<p>
<i>Love.</i> Then doubts, and fears, and anxious cares be gone,<br />
All ye black thoughts that did corrode my breast;<br />
Here enter faith, and confidence, and love!<br />
Love that can't live with jealousy, but dwells<br />
With sacred marriage, truth, and mutual honour.<br />
I knew not where you would bestow your vows,<br />
But never doubted of your faith when given.<br />
[<i>Kissing her hand.</i><br />
<br />
<i>O. Book.</i> You see, my son, how constancy's rewarded!<br />
You have from nature every quality<br />
To make you well become what fortune gave you;<br />
But neither wit nor beauty, wealth nor courage,<br />
Implicitly deserve the world's esteem;<br />
They're only in their application good.<br />
How could you fight a man you knew not why?<br />
You don't think that 'tis great merely to dare?<br />
'Tis that a man is just he should be bold.<br />
Indeed you've erred.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Lat.</i> You give my friend, methinks, too much compunction
for a little levity in his actions&mdash;when he's too
severe in his own reflections on 'em.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> Well, Victoria, you see I take your advice at
last in choice of Lovemore.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> I congratulate your missing of the other.</p>

<p><i>Pen.</i> I heartily believe you, my dear friend.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> But we best guide our actions by hopes of
reward. Could but my son have such a glorious prospect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
as this fair one. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Victoria</span>.] I doubt not but
his future carriage would deserve her.</p>

<p><i>Vict.</i> I believe I may safely promise to approve of all
the truth he tells me.</p>

<p><i>Y. Book.</i> You've promised, then, to like all I shall say.</p>

<p><i>O. Book.</i> These unexpected good events deserve our
celebration with some mirth and fiddles.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I foresaw this happy turn, therefore have prepared 'em.
Call in the dancers.</p>

<h3>EPILOGUE.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Our too advent'rous author soared to-night</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Above the little praise, mirth to excite,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And chose with pity to chastise delight.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For laughter's a distorted passion, born</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of sudden self-esteem and sudden scorn;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which, when 'tis o'er, the men in pleasure wise,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Both him that moved it and themselves despise;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">While generous pity of a painted woe</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Makes us ourselves both more approve and know.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What is that touch within which nature gave</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For man to man e'er fortune made a slave?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sure it descends from that dread Power alone,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who levels thunder from His awful throne,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And shakes both worlds&mdash;yet hears the wretched groan.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Tis what the ancient sage could ne'er define,</span><br />

<p>Steele's third play, <i>The Tender Husband:
or, the Accomplished Fools, a
Comedy</i>, was given to Rich, of the
Theatre Royal, in March, 1705, and
was produced on April 23, when it
ran for five nights, "with several
entertainments of singing by Mrs. Tofts, and dancing";
and again in May and June. The profits were but small.
The play was published by Tonson on the 9th of May.
It was acted several times nearly every year between 1705
and 1736, and occasionally afterwards. In 1760, Garrick
appeared as Sir Harry Gubbin, and in 1802, Charles
Kemble and Mrs. Jordan acted in the piece. Mills
(Clerimont, Sen.), Wilks (Capt. Clerimont), Estcourt
(Pounce), Bullock (Sir Harry Gubbin), Pinkethman
(Humphry Gubbin), Norris (Tipkin), Mrs. Powell
(Aunt), and Mrs. Oldfield (Niece), were in the original
cast. Steele was indebted for some ideas in the fourth
Act to Molière's <i>Sicilien: ou, l'Amour Peintre</i>, and
possibly to Cibber's <i>Careless Husband</i>, which had recently
appeared. In No. 555 of the <i>Spectator</i> he said
that "many applauded strokes" in the piece were from
Addison's hand. Fielding, Goldsmith, and Sheridan
had Steele's play in view when they created the characters
of Squire Western, Tony Lumpkin, and Lydia
Languish. The phrase "accomplished fools" had been
used by Steele in the <i>Lying Lover</i> (p. <a href="#Page_148">148</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>You'll be surprised, in the midst of a
daily and familiar conversation, with
an address which bears so distant an
air as a public dedication. But to
put you out of the pain which I know
this will give you, I assure you I do
not design in it, what would be very
needless, a panegyric on yourself, or what, perhaps, is
very necessary, a defence of the play. In the one I
should discover too much the concern of an author, in
the other too little the freedom of a friend.</p>

<p>My purpose in this application is only to show the
esteem I have for you, and that I look upon my intimacy
with you as one of the most valuable enjoyments of my
life. At the same time I hope I make the Town no
ill compliment for their kind acceptance of this Comedy,
in acknowledging that it has so far raised my opinion of
it, as to make me think it no improper memorial of an
inviolable friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>I should not offer it to you as such, had I not been
very careful to avoid everything that might look ill-natured,
immoral, or prejudicial to what the better part
of mankind hold sacred and honourable.</p>

<p>Poetry, under such restraints, is an obliging service to
human society; especially when it is used, like your
admirable vein, to recommend more useful qualities
in yourself, or immortalise characters truly heroic in
others. I am here in danger of breaking my promise to
you, therefore shall take the only opportunity that can
offer itself of resisting my own inclinations, by complying
with yours. I am,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Your most faithful,</p>

<p>Humble Servant,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the first rise and infancy of farce,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When fools were many, and when plays were scarce,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The raw, unpractised authors could, with ease,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A young and unexperienced audience please;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No single character had e'er been shown,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But the whole herd of fops was all their own;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Rich in originals, they set to view,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In every piece, a coxcomb that was new.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But now our British theatre can boast</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Drolls of all kinds, a vast unthinking host!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fruitful of folly and of vice, it shows</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cuckolds, and cits, and bawds, and pimps, and beaux;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Rough-country knights are found of every shire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of every fashion gentle fops appear;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And punks of different characters we meet,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As frequent on the stage as in the pit.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Our modern wits are forced to pick and cull,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And here and there by chance glean up a fool;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Long ere they find the necessary spark,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They search the Town and beat about the Park;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To all his most frequented haunts resort,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oft dog him to the Ring,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and oft to Court;</span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">However, to do you right, the present age</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Breeds very hopeful monsters for the stage,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That scorn the paths their dull forefathers trod,</span><br />

<h3><i>THE TENDER HUSBAND: OR, THE ACCOMPLISHED FOOLS.</i></h3>


<h3>ACT THE FIRST.</h3>


<p>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Clerimont, Sen.'s</span> <i>House.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Clerimont, Sen.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fainlove</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Well, Mr. Fainlove, how do
you go on in your amour with my
wife?</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> I am very civil and very distant;
if she smiles or speaks, I bow and
gaze at her; then throw down my
eyes, as if oppressed by fear of offence,
then steal a look again till she again sees me. This is
my general method.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> And it is right. For such a fine lady has
no guard to her virtue but her pride; therefore you
must constantly apply yourself to that. But, dear Lucy,
as you have been a very faithful but a very costly wench
to me, so my spouse also has been constant to my bed,
but careless of my fortune.</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> Ah! my dear, how could you leave your poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Lucy, and run into France to see sights, and show your
gallantry with a wife? Was not that unnatural?</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> She brought me a noble fortune, and I
thought she had a right to share it; therefore carried her
to see the world, forsooth, and make the tour of France
and Italy, where she learned to lose her money gracefully,
to admire every vanity in our sex, and contemn
every virtue in her own, which, with ten thousand other
perfections, are the ordinary improvements of a travelled
lady. Now I can neither mortify her vanity, that I may
live at ease with her, or quite discard her, till I have
catched her a little enlarging her innocent freedoms, as she
calls 'em. For this end I am content to be a French
husband, though now and then with the secret pangs of
an Italian one; and therefore, sir, or madam, you are thus
equipped to attend and accost her ladyship. It concerns
you to be diligent. If we wholly part&mdash;I need say no
more. If we do not&mdash;I'll see thee well provided for.</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> I'll do all I can, I warrant you, but you are not
to expect I'll go much among the men.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> No, no; you must not go near men; you
are only (when my wife goes to a play) to sit in a side box
with pretty fellows. I don't design you to personate a
real man, you are only to be a pretty gentleman; not to
be of any use or consequence in the world, as to yourself,
but merely as a property to others; such as you see now
and then have a life in the entail of a great estate, that
seem to have come into the world only to be tags in the
pedigree of a wealthy house. You must have seen many
of that species.</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> I apprehend you; such as stand in assemblies,
with an indolent softness and contempt of all around
them; who make a figure in public and are scorned in
private; I have seen such a one with a pocket glass to
see his own face, and an effective perspective to know
others. [<i>Imitates each.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Ay, ay, that's my man&mdash;thou dear rogue.</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> Let me alone; I'll lay my life I'll horn you&mdash;that
is, I'll make it appear I might if I could.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Ay, that will please me quite as well.</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> To show you the progress I have made, I last
night won of her five hundred pounds, which I have
brought you safe. [<i>Giving him bills.</i></p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Oh the damned vice! That women can
imagine all household care, regard to posterity, and fear
of poverty, must be sacrificed to a game at cards! Suppose
she had not had it to pay, and you had been
capable of finding your account another way?</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> That's but a suppose&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> I say, she must have complied with everything
you asked.</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> But she knows you never limit her expenses.&mdash;I'll
gain him from her for ever if I can. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> With this you have repaid me two thousand
pounds, and if you did not refund thus honestly, I could
not have supplied her. We must have parted.</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> Then you shall part&mdash;if t'other way fails&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;However,
I can't blame your fondness of her,
she has so many entertaining qualities with her vanity.
Then she has such a pretty unthinking air, while she
saunters round a room, and prattles sentences.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> That was her turn from her infancy; she
always had a great genius for knowing everything but
what it was necessary she should. The wits of the age,
the great beauties, and short-lived people of vogue, were
always her discourse and imitation. Thus the case
stood when she went to France; but her fine follies
improved so daily, that though I was then proud of her
being called Mr. Clerimont's wife, I am now as much
out of countenance to hear myself called Mrs. Clerimont's
husband, so much is the superiority of her
side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> I am sure if ever I gave myself a little liberty, I
never found you so indulgent.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> I should have the whole sex on my back,
should I pretend to retrench a lady so well visited as
mine is. Therefore I must bring it about that it shall
appear her own act, if she reforms; or else I shall be
pronounced jealous, and have my eyes pulled out for
being open. But I hear my brother Jack coming, who,
I hope, has brought yours with him&mdash;Hist, not a word.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Captain Clerimont</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Pounce</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cler.</i> I have found him out at last, brother, and
brought you the obsequious Mr. Pounce; I saw him at a
distance in a crowd, whispering in their turns with all
about him. He is a gentleman so received, so courted,
and so trusted&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> I am very glad if you saw anything like that,
if the approbation of others can recommend me (where
I much more desire it) to this company.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Oh, the civil person&mdash;But, dear Pounce, you know
I am your professed admirer; I always celebrated you for
your excellent skill and address, for that happy knowledge
of the world, which makes you seem born for living with
the persons you are with, wherever you come. Now my
brother and I want your help in a business that requires
a little more dexterity than we ourselves are masters of.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> You know, sir, my character is helping the
distressed, which I do freely and without reserve; while
others are for distinguishing rigidly on the justice of the
occasion, and so lose the grace of the benefit. Now 'tis
my profession to assist a free-hearted young fellow against
an unnatural long-lived father; to disencumber men of
pleasure of the vexation of unwieldy estates; to support
a feeble title to an inheritance; to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> I have been well acquainted with your
merits, ever since I saw you with so much compassion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
prompt a stammering witness in Westminster Hall,
that wanted instruction. I love a man that can venture
his ears with so much bravery for his friend.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Dear sir, spare my modesty, and let me know
to what all this panegyric tends.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Why, sir, what I would say is in behalf of
my brother, the Captain, here, whose misfortune it is that
I was born before him.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> I am confident he had rather you should have
been so than any other man in England.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> You do me justice, Mr. Pounce, but though 'tis
to that gentleman, I am still a younger brother, and you
know we that are so, are generally condemned to shops,
colleges, or inns of court.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> But you, sir, have escaped 'em, you have been
trading in the noble mart of glory.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> That's true. But the general makes such haste
to finish the war, that we red coats may be soon out of
fashion; and then I am a fellow of the most easy
indolent disposition in the world! I hate all manner of
business.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> A composed temper, indeed!</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> In such a case I should have no way of livelihood,
but calling over this gentleman's dogs in the
country, drinking his stale beer to the neighbourhood,
or marrying a fortune.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> To be short, Pounce&mdash;I am putting Jack
upon marriage, and you are so public an envoy, or
rather plenipotentiary, from the very different nations of
Cheapside, Covent Garden, and St. James's; you have,
too, the mien and language of each place so naturally,
that you are the properest instrument I know in the
world, to help an honest young fellow to favour in one
of 'em, by credit in the other.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> By what I understand of your many prefaces,
gentlemen, the purpose of all this is, that it would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
in the least discompose this gentleman's easy indolent
disposition to fall into twenty thousand pounds, though
it came upon him never so suddenly.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> You are a very discerning man; how could
you see so far through me, as to know I love a fine
woman, pretty equipage, good company, and a clean
habitation?</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Well, though I am so much a conjurer&mdash;what
then?</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> You know a certain person, into whose
hands you now and then recommend a young heir, to be
relieved from the vexation of tenants, taxes, and so
forth&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> What! My worthy friend and city patron
Hezekiah Tipkin, banker in Lombard Street; would the
noble Captain lay any sums in his hands?</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> No; but the noble Captain would have treasure
out of his hands. You know his niece?</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> To my knowledge ten thousand pounds in
money.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Such a stature, such a blooming countenance, so
easy a shape!</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> In jewels of her grandmother's five thousand.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Her wit so lively, her mien so alluring!</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> In land a thousand a year.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Her lips have that certain prominence, that
swelling softness that they invite to a pressure; her eyes
that languish, that they give pain, though they look only
inclined to rest; her whole person that one charm&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Raptures! Raptures!</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> How can it, so insensibly to itself, lead us
through cares it knows not, through such a wilderness
of hopes, fears, joys, sorrows, desires, despairs, ecstasies
and torments, with so sweet, yet so anxious vicissitude!</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Why, I thought you had never seen her?</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> No more I han't.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Who told you then of her inviting lips, her
soft sleepy eyes?</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> You yourself.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Sure you rave, I never spoke of her afore to you.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Why, you won't face me down&mdash;Did you not
just now say she had ten thousand pounds in money,
five in jewels, and a thousand a year?</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> I confess my own stupidity and her charms.
Why, if you were to meet, you would certainly please her,
you have the cant of loving; but pray, may we be free&mdash;that
young gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> A very honest, modest gentleman of my acquaintance,
one that has much more in him than he appears to
have. You shall know him better, sir; this is Mr. Pounce;
Mr. Pounce, this is Mr. Fainlove; I must desire you to
let him be known to you and your friends.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> I shall be proud. Well then, since we may
be free, you must understand, the young lady, by being
kept from the world, has made a world of her own. She
has spent all her solitude in reading romances, her head
is full of shepherds, knights, flowery meads, groves, and
streams, so that if you talk like a man of this world to
her, you do nothing.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Oh, let me alone&mdash;I have been a great traveller
in fairy-land myself, I know Oroondates; Cassandra,
Astræa and Clelia<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> are my intimate acquaintance.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Go my heart's envoys, tender sighs make haste,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And with your breath swell the soft zephyr's blast;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then near that fair one if you chance to fly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Tell her, in whispers, 'tis for her I die.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> That would do, that would do&mdash;her very language.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Why then, dear Pounce, I know thou art
the only man living that can serve him.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Gentlemen, you must pardon me, I am
soliciting the marriage settlement between her and a
country booby, her cousin, Humphry Gubbin, Sir
Harry's heir, who is come to town to take possession
of her.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Well, all that I can say to the matter is,
that a thousand pounds on the day of Jack's marriage to
her, is more than you'll get by the despatch of those
deeds.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Why, a thousand pounds is a pretty thing,
especially when 'tis to take a lady fair out of the hands
of an obstinate ill-bred clown, to give her to a gentle
swain, a dying enamoured knight.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Ay, dear Pounce, consider but that&mdash;the
justice of the thing.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Besides, he is just come from the glorious
Blenheim!<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Look ye, Captain, I hope you have learned
an implicit obedience to your leaders.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> 'Tis all I know.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Then, if I am to command, make not one
step without me. And since we may be free, I am also
to acquaint you, there will be more merit in bringing
this matter to bear than you imagine. Yet right measures
make all things possible.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> We'll follow yours exactly.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> But the great matter against us is want of
time, for the nymph's uncle, and 'squire's father, this
morning met, and made an end of the matter. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
difficulty of a thing, Captain, shall be no reason against
attempting it.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> I have so great an opinion of your conduct, that
I warrant you we conquer all.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> I am so intimately employed by old Tipkin,
and so necessary to him, that I may, perhaps, puzzle
things yet.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> I have seen thee cajole the knave very
dexterously.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Why, really, sir, generally speaking, 'tis but
knowing what a man thinks of himself, and giving him
that, to make him what else you please. Now Tipkin is
an absolute Lombard Street wit, a fellow that drolls on
the strength of fifty thousand pounds. He is called on
'change, Sly-boots, and by the force of a very good
credit, and very bad conscience, he is a leading person.
But we must be quick, or he'll sneer old Sir Harry out
of his senses, and strike up the sale of his niece immediately.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> But my rival, what's he?</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> There's some hopes there, for I hear the
booby is as averse as his father is inclined to it. One is
as obstinate as the other is cruel.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> He is, they say, a pert blockhead, and very
lively out of his father's sight.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> He that gave me his character called him a
docile dunce, a fellow rather absurd, than a direct fool.
When his father's absent, he'll pursue anything he's put
upon. But we must not lose time. Pray be you two
brothers at home to wait for any notice from me, while
that pretty gentleman and I, whose face I have known,
take a walk and look about for 'em&mdash;So, so, young lady.
[<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Fainlove</span>.] [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>


<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>St. James's Park.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Harry Gubbin</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Tipkin</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Look ye, brother Tipkin, as I told you
before, my business in town is to dispose of an hundred
head of cattle, and my son.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Brother Gubbin, as I signified to you in my last,
bearing date September 13th, my niece has a thousand
pounds per annum, and because I have found you a
plain-dealing man (particularly in the easy pad you put
into my hands last summer), I was willing you should
have the refusal of my niece, provided that I have a
discharge from all retrospects while her guardian, and
one thousand pounds for my care.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Ay, but brother, you rate her too high, the war
has fetched down the price of women; the whole nation
is overrun with petticoats; our daughters lie upon our
hands, Brother Tipkin; girls are drugs, sir, mere drugs.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Look ye, Sir Harry, let girls be what they will, a
thousand pounds a year, is a thousand pounds a year; and
a thousand pounds a year is neither girl nor boy.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Look ye, Mr. Tipkin, the main article with
me is, that foundation of wive's rebellion, and husband's
cuckoldom, that cursed pin-money. Five hundred pounds
per annum pin-money!</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> The word pin-money, Sir Harry, is a term.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> It is a term, brother, we never had in our
family, nor ever will. Make her jointure in widowhood
accordingly large, but four hundred pounds a year is
enough to give no account of.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Well, Sir Harry, since you can't swallow these
pins, I will abate to four hundred pounds.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> And to mollify the article, as well as specify
the uses, we'll put in the names of several female
utensils, as needles, knitting-needles, tape, thread, scissors,
bodkins, fans, play-books, with other toys of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
nature. And now, since we have as good as concluded
on the marriage, it will not be improper that the young
people see each other.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> I don't think it prudent till the very instant of
marriage, lest they should not like one another.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> They shall meet&mdash;As for the young girl, she
cannot dislike Numps; and for Numps, I never suffered
him to have anything he liked in his life. He'll be here
immediately; he has been trained up from his childhood
under such a plant as this, in my hand&mdash;I have taken
pains in his education.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Sir Harry, I approve your method; for since you
have left off hunting you might otherwise want exercise,
and this is a subtle expedient to preserve your own health
and your son's good manners.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> It has been the custom of the Gubbins to
preserve severity and discipline in their families: I myself
was caned the day before my wedding.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Ay, Sir Harry, had you not been well cudgelled
in your youth, you had never been the man you are.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> You say right, sir, now I feel the benefit
of it. There's a crab-tree near your house which flourishes
for the good of my posterity, and has brushed our jackets
from father to son, for several generations.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> I am glad to hear you have all things necessary
for the family within yourselves.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Oh, yonder, I see Numps is coming&mdash;I
have dressed him in the very suit I had on at my own
wedding; 'tis a most becoming apparel.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Humphry Gubbin</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Truly, the youth makes a good marriageable
figure.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Come forward, Numps; this is your uncle
Tipkin, your mother's brother, Numps, that is so kind as
to bestow his niece upon you.&mdash;Don't be so glum, sirrah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
don't bow to a man with a face as if you'd knock him
down, don't, sirrah. [<i>Apart.</i></p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> I am glad to see you, cousin Humphry.&mdash;He is
not talkative, I observe already.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> He is very shrewd, sir, when he pleases.&mdash;Do
you see this crab-stick, you dog? [<i>Apart.</i>]&mdash;Well,
Numps, don't be out of humour.&mdash;Will you talk? [<i>Apart.</i>]&mdash;Come,
we're your friends, Numps; come, lad.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> You are a pure fellow for a father. This is
always your tricks, to make a great fool of one before
company. [<i>Apart to his father.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Don't disgrace me, sirrah, you grim, graceless
rogue&mdash;[<i>Apart.</i>]&mdash;Brother, he has been bred up to respect
and silence before his parents. Yet did you but hear
what a noise he makes sometimes in the kitchen, or the
kennel&mdash;he's the loudest of 'em all.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Well, Sir Harry, since you assure me he can
speak, I'll take your word for it.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> I can speak when I see occasion, and I can
hold my tongue when I see occasion.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Well said, Numps&mdash;Sirrah, I see you can
do well, if you will. [<i>Apart.</i></p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Pray walk up to me, cousin Humphry.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Ay, walk to and fro between us with your
hat under your arm.&mdash;Clear up your countenance. [<i>Apart.</i></p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> I see, Sir Harry, you han't set him a-capering
under a French dancing-master. He does not mince
it. He has not learned to walk by a courant or a boree.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
His paces are natural, Sir Harry.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> I don't know, but 'tis so we walk in the West
of England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Ay, right, Numps, and so we do. Ha! ha!
ha! Pray, brother, observe his make, none of your lath-backed
wishy-washy breed. Come hither, Numps&mdash;Can't
you stand still? [<i>Apart.</i>]
[<i>Measuring his shoulders.</i></p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> I presume this is not the first time, Sir Harry,
you have measured his shoulders with your cane.</p>

<p><i>Sir Mar.</i> Look ye, brother, two foot and a-half in the
shoulders.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Two foot and a-half? We must make some
settlement on the younger children.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Not like him, quotha'!</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> He may see his cousin when he pleases.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> But harkee, uncle, I have a scruple I had
better mention before marriage than after.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> What's that? What's that?</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> My cousin, you know, is akin to me, and I
don't think it lawful for a young man to marry his own
relations.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Harkee, harkee, Numps, we have got a
way to solve all that.&mdash;Sirrah! Consider this cudgel!
Your cousin! suppose I'd have you marry your grandmother;
what then? [<i>Apart.</i></p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Well, has your father satisfied you in the point,
Mr. Humphry?</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Ay, ay, sir, very well. I have not the least
scruple remaining; no, no&mdash;not in the least, sir.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Then harkee, brother, we'll go take a whet and
settle the whole affair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Come, we'll leave Numps here: he knows
the way&mdash;Not marry your own relations, sirrah! [<i>Apart.</i>
[<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Very fine, very fine! How prettily this park
is stocked with soldiers, and deer, and ducks, and ladies!&mdash;Ha!
where are the old fellows gone? where can they
be tro'&mdash;&mdash;I'll ask these people.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Pounce</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fainlove</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Ha, you pretty young gentleman, did you see
my father?</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> Your father, sir?</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> A weazel-faced cross old gentleman with spindle-shanks?</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> No, sir.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> A crab-tree stick in his hand?</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> We han't met anybody with these marks; but
sure I have seen you before&mdash;Are not you Mr. Humphry
Gubbin, son and heir to Sir Henry Gubbin?</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> I am his son and heir&mdash;but how long I shall
be so I can't tell, for he talks every day of disinheriting
me.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Dear sir, let me embrace you&mdash;Nay, don't be
offended if I take the liberty to kiss you. Mr. Fainlove,
pray [<span class="smcap">Fainlove</span> <i>kisses</i>] kiss the gentleman&mdash;Nay, dear
sir, don't stare and be surprised, for I have had a desire
to be better known to you ever since I saw you one day
clinch your fist at your father when his back was turned
upon you; for I must own I very much admire a young
gentleman of spirit.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Why, sir, would it not vex a man to the heart
to have an old fool snubbing a body every minute afore
company?</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Oh fie, he uses you like a boy.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Like a boy! He lays me on now and then
as if I were one of his hounds. You can't think what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
rage he was in this morning because I boggled a little at
marrying my own cousin.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> A man can't be too scrupulous, Mr. Humphry&mdash;a
man can't be too scrupulous.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Sir, I could as soon love my own flesh and
blood; we should squabble like brother and sister; do
you think we should not? Mr.&mdash;&mdash;Pray, gentlemen,
may I crave the favour of your names?</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Sir, I am the very person that has been
employed to draw up the articles of marriage between
you and your cousin.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Ay, say you so? Then you can inform me in
some things concerning myself&mdash;Pray, sir, what estate
am I heir to?</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> To fifteen hundred pounds a year, an entailed
estate.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> I am glad to hear it with all my heart; and
can you satisfy me in another question&mdash;Pray how old
am I at present?</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Three-and-twenty last March.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Why, as sure as you are there, they have kept
me back. I have been told by some of the neighbourhood
that I was born the very year the pigeon-house
was built, and everybody knows the pigeon-house is
three-and-twenty. Why! I find there have been tricks
played me. I have obeyed him all along, as if I had
been obliged to it.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Not at all, sir; your father can't cut you out
of one acre of fifteen hundred pounds a year.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> What a fool have I been to give him his head
so long!</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> A man of your beauty and fortune may find
out ladies enough that are not akin to you.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Look ye, Mr. what d'ye call&mdash;as to my
beauty, I don't know but they may take a liking to that.
But, sir, mayn't I crave your name?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> My name, sir, is Pounce, at your service.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Pounce, with a P?</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Yes, sir, and Samuel, with an S.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Why, then, Mr. Samuel Pounce, do you know
any gentlewoman that you think I could like? For, to
tell you truly, I took an antipathy to my cousin ever
since my father proposed her to me; and since everybody
knows I came up to be married, I don't care to go
down and look balked.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> I have a thought just come into my head&mdash;Do
you see this young gentleman? He has a sister, a
prodigious fortune. 'Faith, you two shall be acquainted.</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> I can't pretend to expect so accomplished a
gentleman as Mr. Humphry for my sister, but being
your friend, I'll be at his service in the affair.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> If I had your sister, she and I should live like
two turtles.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Mr. Humphry, you shan't be fooled any
longer; I'll carry you into company. Mr. Fainlove,
you shall introduce him to Mrs. Clerimont's toilet.</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> She'll be highly taken with him; for she loves a
gentleman whose manner is particular.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> What, sir, a person of your pretensions, a clear
estate, no portions to pay! 'Tis barbarous, your treatment.&mdash;Mr.
Humphry, I'm afraid you want money.
There's for you&mdash;What, a man of your accomplishments!
[<i>Giving a purse.</i></p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> And yet you see, sir, how they use me. Dear
sir, you are the best friend I ever met with in all my
life. Now I am flush of money, bring me to your sister,
and I warrant you for my behaviour&mdash;A man's quite
another thing with money in his pocket, you know.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> How little the oaf wonders why I should give
him money! [<i>Aside</i>].&mdash;You shall never want, Mr. Humphry,
while I have it, Mr. Humphry; but dear friend, I
must take my leave of you; I have some extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
business on my hands. I can't stay; but you must not
say a word.</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> But you must be in the way half-an-hour hence,
and I'll introduce you at Mrs. Clerimont's.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Make 'em believe you are willing to have your
cousin Bridget, till opportunity serves. Farewell, dear
friend. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Pounce</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fain.</span></p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Farewell, good Mr. Samuel Pounce.&mdash;But
let's see my cash&mdash; 'tis very true, the old saying, a man
meets with more friendship from strangers than his own
relations&mdash;Let's see my cash: 1, 2, 3, 4, there on that
side; 1, 2, 3, 4, on that side; 'tis a foolish thing to put
all one's money in one pocket; 'tis like a man's whole
estate in one county&mdash;These five in my fob&mdash;I'll keep
these in my hand, lest I should have a present occasion.&mdash;But
this town's full of pickpockets; I'll go home again.

<h3>ACT THE SECOND.</h3>

<h4>SCENE.&mdash;<i>The Park.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Pounce</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Captain Clerimont</span> <i>with his arm
in a scarf.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> You are now well enough
instructed both in the aunt and
niece to form your behaviour.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> But to talk with her apart is
the great matter.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> The antiquated virgin has
a mighty affectation for youth, and is
a great lover of men and money&mdash;One of these, at least,
I am sure I can gratify her in, by turning her pence in
the annuities, or the stocks of one of the companies;
some way or other I'll find to entertain her, and engage
you with the young lady.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Since that is her ladyship's turn, so busy and
fine a gentleman as Mr. Pounce must needs be in her
good graces.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> So shall you too&mdash;but you must not be seen
with me at first meeting; I'll dog 'em, while you watch
at a distance. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Aunt</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Niece</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Was it not my gallant that whistled so charmingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
in the parlour before he went out this morning?
He's a most accomplished cavalier.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Come, niece, come; you don't do well to make
sport with your relations, especially with a young gentleman
that has so much kindness for you.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Kindness for me! What a phrase is there to
express the darts and flames, the sighs and languishings,
of an expecting lover!</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Pray, niece, forbear this idle trash, and talk like
other people. Your cousin Humphry will be true and
hearty in what he says, and that's a great deal better
than the talk and compliment of romances.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Good madam, don't wound my ears with such
expressions; do you think I can ever love a man that's
true and hearty? What a peasant-like amour do these
coarse words import! True and hearty! Pray, aunt,
endeavour a little at the embellishment of your style.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Alack-a-day, cousin Biddy, these idle romances
have quite turned your head.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> How often must I desire you, madam, to lay
aside that familiar name, cousin Biddy? I never hear it
without blushing&mdash;Did you ever meet with a heroine
in those idle romances, as you call 'em, that was termed
Biddy?</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Ah! cousin, cousin, these are mere vapours,
indeed; nothing but vapours.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> No, the heroine has always something soft and
engaging in her name; something that gives us a notion
of the sweetness of her beauty and behaviour; a name
that glides through half-a-dozen tender syllables, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Elismonda, Clidamira, Deidamia, that runs upon vowels
off the tongue; not hissing through one's teeth, or breaking
them with consonants. 'Tis strange rudeness those
familiar names they give us, when there is Aurelia,
Sacharissa, Gloriana, for people of condition; and Celia,
Chloris, Corinna, Mopsa, for their maids and those of
lower rank.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Look ye, Biddy, this is not to be supported. I
know not where you learned this nicety; but I can tell
you, forsooth, as much as you despise it, your mother
was a Bridget afore you, and an excellent house-wife.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Good madam, don't upbraid me with my mother
Bridget, and an excellent house-wife.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Yes, I say she was; and spent her time in better
learning than you ever did&mdash;not in reading of fights and
battles of dwarfs and giants, but in writing out receipts
for broths, possets, caudles, and surfeit-waters, as became
a good country gentlewoman.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> My mother, and a Bridget!</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Yes, niece, I say again, your mother, my sister,
was a Bridget! the daughter of her mother Margery, of
her mother Sisly, of her mother Alice.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Have you no mercy? Oh, the barbarous
genealogy!</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Of her mother Winifred, of her mother Joan.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Since you will run on, then I must needs tell
you I am not satisfied in the point of my nativity. Many
an infant has been placed in a cottage with obscure
parents, till by chance some ancient servant of the
family has known it by its marks.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Ay, you had best be searched&mdash;That's like
your calling the winds the fanning gales, before I don't
know how much company; and the tree that was blown
by it had, forsooth, a spirit imprisoned in the trunk
of it.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Ignorance!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Then a cloud this morning had a flying dragon
in it.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> What eyes had you, that you could see nothing?
For my part I look upon it to be a prodigy, and expect
something extraordinary will happen to me before night.&mdash;But
you have a gross relish of things. What noble descriptions
in romances had been lost, if the writers had
been persons of your goût?</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> I wish the authors had been hanged, and their
books burnt, before you had seen 'em.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Simplicity!</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> A parcel of improbable lies.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Indeed, madam, your raillery is coarse&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Fit only to corrupt young girls, and fill their
heads with a thousand foolish dreams of I don't know
what.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Nay, now, madam, you grow extravagant.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> What I say is not to vex, but advise you for
your good.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> What, to burn Philocles, Artaxeres, Oroondates,
and the rest of the heroic lovers, and take my
country booby, cousin Humphry, for a husband!</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Oh dear, oh dear, Biddy! Pray, good dear,
learn to act and speak like the rest of the world; come,
come, you shall marry your cousin and live comfortably.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Live comfortably! What kind of life is that?
A great heiress live comfortably! Pray, aunt, learn to
raise your ideas&mdash;What is, I wonder, to live comfortably?</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> To live comfortably is to live with prudence
and frugality, as we do in Lombard Street.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> As we do! That's a fine life, indeed, with one
servant of each sex. Let's see how many things our
coachman is good for&mdash;He rubs down his horses,
lays the cloth, whets the knives, and sometimes makes
beds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> A good servant should turn his hand to everything
in a family.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Nay, there's not a creature in our family that
has not two or three different duties. As John is butler,
footman, and coachman, so Mary is cook, laundress,
and chamber-maid.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Well, and do you laugh at that?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> No, not I; nor at the coach-horses, though one
has an easy trot for my uncle's riding, and t'other an
easy pace for your side-saddle.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> And so you jeer at the good management of
your relations, do you?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> No, I'm well satisfied that all the house are
creatures of business; but, indeed, was in hopes that my
poor little lap-dog might have lived with me upon my
fortune without an employment; but my uncle threatens
every day to make him a turn-spit, that he too, in his
sphere, may help us to live comfortably.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Hark ye, cousin Biddy.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> I vow I'm out of countenance when our butler,
with his careful face, drives us all stowed in a chariot
drawn by one horse ambling and t'other trotting, with
his provisions behind for the family, from Saturday night
till Monday morning, bound for Hackney&mdash;then we
make a comfortable figure, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> So we do, and so will you always, if you marry
your cousin Humphry.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Name not the creature.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Creature! What, your own cousin a creature!</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Oh, let's be going. I see yonder another creature
that does my uncle's law business, and has, I believe,
made ready the deeds&mdash;those barbarous deeds!</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> What, Mr. Pounce a creature too! Nay, now
I'm sure you're ignorant. You shall stay, and you'll learn
more wit from him in an hour, than in a thousand of your
foolish books in an age&mdash;&mdash;Your servant, Mr. Pounce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Pounce</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Ladies, I hope I don't interrupt any private
discourse.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Not in the least, sir.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> I should be loth to be esteemed one of those
who think they have a privilege of mixing in all companies,
without any business but to bring forth a loud
laugh or vain jest.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> He talks with the mien and gravity of a Paladin.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Madam, I bought the other day at three and a-half,
and sold at seven&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Then pray sir, sell for me in time. Niece, mind
him; he has an infinite deal of wit.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> This that I speak of was for you. I never
neglect such opportunities to serve my friends.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Indeed, Mr. Pounce, you are, I protest without
flattery, the wittiest man in the world.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> I assure you, madam, I said last night, before
an hundred head of citizens, that Mrs. Barsheba Tipkin
was the most ingenious young lady in the Liberties.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Well, Mr. Pounce, you are so facetious&mdash;But
you are always among the great ones; 'tis no wonder
you have it.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Idle! Idle!</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> But, madam, you know Alderman Grey-Goose,
he's a notable joking man. Well, says he, here's Mrs.
Barsheba's health; she's my mistress.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> That man makes me split my sides with laughing,
he's such a wag.&mdash;Mr. Pounce pretends Grey-Goose
said all this, but I know 'tis his own wit, for he's in love
with me. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> But, madam, there's a certain affair I should
communicate to you. [<i>Apart.</i></p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Ay, 'tis certainly so&mdash;he wants to break his
mind to me. [<i>Aside.</i>]</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Captain Clerimont</span> <i>passing.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Oh, Mr. Clerimont, Mr. Clerimont&mdash;&mdash;Ladies,
pray let me introduce this young gentleman; he's my
friend, a youth of great virtue and goodness, for all he's
in a red coat.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> If he's your friend we need not doubt his virtue.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Ladies, you are taking the cool breath of the
morning.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> A pretty phrase. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> That's the pleasantest time this warm weather.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Oh, 'tis the season of the pearly dews and gentle
zephyrs.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Ay! pray mind that again, aunt. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Shan't we repose ourselves on yonder seat?
I love improving company, and to communicate.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> 'Tis certainly so. He's in love with me, and
wants opportunity to tell me so [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;I don't care if
we do&mdash;He's a most ingenious man. [<i>Aside.</i>
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Aunt</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Pounce</span>.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> We enjoy here, madam, all the pretty landscapes
of the country without the pains of going thither.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Art and nature are in a rivalry, or rather a confederacy,
to adorn this beauteous park with all the agreeable
variety of water, shade, walks, and air. What can
be more charming than these flowery lawns?</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Or these gloomy shades&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Or these embroidered valleys&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Or that transparent stream&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Or these bowing branches on the banks of it, that
seem to admire their own beauty in the crystal mirror?</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> I am surprised, madam, at the delicacy of your
phrase. Can such expressions come from Lombard Street?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Alas, sir! what can be expected from an innocent
virgin that has been immured almost one-and-twenty
years from the conversation of mankind, under the care
of an Urganda<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> of an aunt?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Bless me, madam, how have you been abused!
Many a lady before your age has had an hundred lances
broken in her service, and as many dragons cut to
pieces in honour of her.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Oh, the charming man! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Do you believe Pamela was one-and-twenty
before she knew Musidorus?<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> I could hear him ever. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> A lady of your wit and beauty might have given
occasion for a whole romance in folio before that age.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Oh, the powers! Who can he be?&mdash;Oh, youth
unknown&mdash;But let me, in the first place, know whom I
talk to, for, sir, I am wholly unacquainted both with your
person and your history. You seem, indeed, by your
deportment, and the distinguishing mark of your bravery
which you bear, to have been in a conflict. May I not
know what cruel beauty obliged you to such adventures
till she pitied you?</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Oh, the pretty coxcomb! [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Oh, Blenheim,
Blenheim! Oh, Cordelia, Cordelia!</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> You mention the place of battle. I would fain
hear an exact description of it. Our public papers are
so defective; they don't so much as tell us how the
sun rose on that glorious day&mdash;Were there not a great
many flights of vultures before the battle began?</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Oh, madam, they have eaten up half my acquaintance.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Certainly never birds of prey were so feasted;
by report, they might have lived half-a-year on the very
legs and arms our troops left behind 'em.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Had we not fought near a wood we should never
have got legs enough to have come home upon. The
joiner of the Foot Guards has made his fortune by it.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> I shall never forgive your General. He has put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
all my ancient heroes out of countenance; he has pulled
down Cyrus and Alexander, as much as Louis-le-Grand&mdash;But
your own part in that action?</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Only that slight hurt, for the astrologer said at
my nativity, nor fire, nor sword, nor pike, nor musket
shall destroy this child, let him but avoid fair eyes&mdash;&mdash;But,
madam, mayn't I crave the name of her that has
so captivated my heart?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> I can't guess whom you mean by that description;
but if you ask my name, I must confess you put
me upon revealing what I always keep as the greatest
secret I have&mdash;for would you believe it, they have called
me&mdash;I don't know how to own it, but they have called
me&mdash;Bridget.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Bridget?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Bridget.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Bridget?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Spare my confusion, I beseech you, sir; and if
you have occasion to mention me, let it be by Parthenissa,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
for that's the name I have assumed ever since I came to
years of discretion.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> The insupportable tyranny of parents, to fix names
on helpless infants which they must blush at all their lives
after! I don't think there's a surname in the world to
match it.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> No! What do you think of Tipkin?</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Tipkin! Why, I think if I was a young lady that
had it I'd part with it immediately.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Pray, how would you get rid of it?</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> I'd change it for another. I could recommend
to you three very pretty syllables&mdash;What do you think
of Clerimont?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Clerimont! Clerimont! Very well&mdash;but what
right have I to it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> If you will give me leave, I'll put you in possession
of it. By a very few words I can make it over to
you, and your children after you.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> O fie! Whither are you running? You know
a lover should sigh in private, and languish whole years
before he reveals his passion; he should retire into some
solitary grove, and make the woods and wild beasts his
confidants. You should have told it to the echo half-a-year
before you had discovered it, even to my handmaid.
And yet besides&mdash;to talk to me of children! Did you
ever hear of a heroine with a big belly?</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> What can a lover do, madam, now the race of
giants is extinct? Had I lived in those days there had
not been a mortal six foot high, but should have owned
Parthenissa for the paragon of beauty, or measured his
length on the ground&mdash;&mdash;Parthenissa should have been
heard by the brooks and deserts at midnight, the echo's
burden and the river's murmur.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> That had been a golden age, indeed! But see,
my aunt has left her grave companion and is coming
toward us&mdash;&mdash;I command you to leave me.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Thus Oroondates, when Statira<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> dismissed him
her presence, threw himself at her feet, and implored permission
but to live. [<i>Offering to kneel.</i></p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> And thus Statira raised him from the earth, permitting
him to live and love. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Cler.</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Aunt</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Is not Mr. Pounce's conversation very improving,
niece?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Is not Clerimont a very pretty name, aunt?</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> He has so much prudence.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> He has so much gallantry.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> So sententious in his expressions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> So polished in his language.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> All he says is, methinks, so like a sermon.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> All he speaks savours of romance.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Romance, niece? Mr. Pounce! what savours
of romance?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> No, I mean his friend, the accomplished Mr.
Clerimont.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Fie, for one of your years to commend a young
fellow!</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> One of my years is mightily governed by
example! You did not dislike Mr. Pounce.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> What, censorious too? I find there is no
trusting you out of the house&mdash;A moment's fresh air
does but make you still the more in love with strangers,
and despise your own relations.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> I am certainly by the power of an enchantment
placed among you, but I hope I, this morning, employed
one to seek adventures, and break the charm.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Vapours, Biddy, indeed! Nothing but vapours.
Cousin Humphry shall break the charm.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Name him not&mdash;Call me still Biddy rather than
name that brute. [<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Aunt</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Niece</span>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Captain Clerimont</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Pounce</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cler.</i> A perfect Quixote in petticoats! I tell thee,
Pounce, she governs herself wholly by romance&mdash;it has
got into her very blood. She starts by rule, and blushes
by example. Could I but have produced one instance
of a lady's complying at first sight, I should have gained
her promise on the spot. How am I bound to curse the
cold constitutions of the Philocleas and Statiras? I am
undone for want of precedents.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> I am sure I laboured hard to favour your
conference, and plied the old woman all the while with
something that tickled either her vanity or her covetousness;
I considered all the stocks, Old and New Company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
her own complexion and youth, partners for sword-blades,
Chamber of London, banks for charity, and mine adventures,
till she told me I had the repute of the most facetious
man that ever came to Garraway's<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>&mdash;For you must
know public knaves and stock-jobbers pass for wits at her
end of the town, as common cheats and gamesters do at
yours.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> I pity the drudgery you have gone through;
but what's next to be done towards getting my pretty
heroine?</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> What should next be done in ordinary method
of things? You have seen her; the next regular approach
is that you cannot subsist a moment without sending
forth musical complaints of your misfortune by way of
serenade.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> I can nick you there, sir. I have a scribbling
army friend that has writ a triumphant, rare, noisy song
in honour of the late victory, that will hit the nymph's
fantasque to a hair. I'll get everything ready as fast as
possible.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> While you are playing upon the fort, I'll be
within and observe what execution you do, and give you
intelligence accordingly.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> You must have an eye upon Mr. Humphry while
I feed the vanity of Parthenissa; for I am so experienced
in these matters that I know none but coxcombs think
to win a woman by any desert of their own&mdash;No, it
must be done rather by complying with some prevailing
humour of your mistress, than exerting any good quality
in yourself.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Tis not the lover's merit wins the field,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But to themselves alone the beauteous yield.</span><br />

<h3>ACT THE THIRD.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mrs. Clerimont's</span> <i>Room.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Clerimont, Fainlove</span> <i>(carrying her lap-dog),
and</i> <span class="smcap">Jenny</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Madam, the footman that's recommended
to you is below, if your ladyship
will please to take him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> O fie; don't believe
I'll think on't. It is impossible he
should be good for anything&mdash;The
English are so saucy with their liberty&mdash;I'll have all my
lower servants French. There cannot be a good footman
born out of an absolute monarchy.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> I am beholden to your ladyship for believing so
well of the maidservants in England.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Indeed, Jenny, I could wish thou wert
really French; for thou art plain English in spite of
example. Your arms do but hang on, and you move
perfectly upon joints; not with a swim of the whole
person&mdash;But I am talking to you, and have not adjusted
myself to-day: What pretty company a glass is, to have
another self! [<i>Kisses the dog.</i>] To converse in soliloquy!
To have company that never contradicts or displeases us!
The pretty visible echo of our actions! [<i>Kisses the dog.</i>]
How easy, too, it is to be disencumbered with stays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
where a woman has anything like shape; if no shape, a
good air&mdash;But I look best when I'm talking.
[<i>Kisses the lap-dog in</i> <span class="smcap">Fainlove's</span> <i>arms.</i></p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> You always look well.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> For I'm always talking, you mean so; that
disquiets thy sullen English temper; but I don't really
look so well when I am silent. If I do but offer to speak,
then I may say that&mdash;Oh, bless me, Jenny, I am so pale,
I am afraid of myself&mdash;I have not laid on half red
enough&mdash;What a dough-baked thing was I before I improved
myself, and travelled for beauty! However, my
face is very prettily designed to-day.</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> Indeed, madam, you begin to have so fine
an hand, that you are younger every day than other.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> The ladies abroad used to call me
Mademoiselle Titian, I was so famous for my colouring;
but prithee, wench, bring me my black eyebrows out of
the next room.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Madam, I have 'em in my hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> It would be happy for all that are to see you
to-day, if you could change your eyes, too.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Gallant enough&mdash;no, hang it, I'll wear
these I have on; this mode of visage takes mightily. I
had three ladies last week came over to my complexion.
I think to be a fair woman this fortnight, till I find I'm
aped too much&mdash;I believe there are an hundred copies
of me already.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Dear madam, won't your ladyship please to let
me be of the next countenance you leave off?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> You may, Jenny; but I assure you it is a
very pretty piece of ill-nature, for a woman that has any
genius for beauty to observe the servile imitation of her
manner, her motion, her glances, and her smiles.</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> Ay, indeed, madam, nothing can be so ridiculous
as to imitate the inimitable.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Indeed, as you say, Fainlove, the French
mien is no more to be learned than the language, without
going thither. Then, again, to see some poor ladies
who have clownish, penurious, English husbands, turn
and torture their old clothes into so many forms, and
dye 'em into so many colours, to follow me&mdash;What say'st,
Jenny? What say'st? Not a word?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Why, madam, all that I can say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Nay, I believe, Jenny, thou hast nothing to
say any more than the rest of thy country-women. The
splenatics speak just as the weather lets 'em; they are
mere talking barometers. Abroad the people of quality
go on so eternally, and still go on, and are gay and entertain.
In England discourse is made up of nothing but
question and answer. I was t'other day at a visit, where
there was a profound silence, for, I believe, the third part
of a minute.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> And your ladyship there?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> They infected me me with their dulness; who
can keep up their good humour at an English visit? They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
sit as at a funeral, silent in the midst of many candles.
One, perhaps, alarms the room&mdash;"'Tis very cold
weather"&mdash;then all the mutes play their fans till some
other question happens, and then the fans go off again.</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Madam, your spinet-master is come.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Bring him in; he's very pretty company.</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> His spinet is; he never speaks himself.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Speak, simpleton! What then; he keeps
out silence, does not he?&mdash;Oh, sir, you must forgive me;
I have been very idle. Well, you pardon me. [<i>Master
bows.</i>] Did you think I was perfect in the song? [<i>Bows</i>]&mdash;but
pray let me hear it once more. Let us see it&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Reads.</i></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><span class="smcap">Song</span>.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With studied airs, and practised smiles,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Flavia my ravished heart beguiles;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The charms we make, are ours alone,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nature's works are not our own;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her skilful hand gives every grace,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And shows her fancy in her face.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She feeds with art an amourous rage,</span><br />

<p>You sing it very well; but, I confess, I wish you'd give
more in to the French manner&mdash;Observe me hum it à-la-Française.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"With studied airs," &amp;c.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The whole person, every limb, every nerve sings. The English
way is only being for that time a mere musical instrument,
just sending forth a sound without knowing they do
so. Now I'll give you a little of it, like an Englishwoman:
You are to suppose I've denied you twenty times, looked
silly, and all that&mdash;then, with hands and face insensible&mdash;I
have a mighty cold.</p>

Mr. Gubbin, son and heir to Sir Harry Gubbin, to
your ladyship's notice?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Mr. Gubbin, I am extremely pleased with
your suit; 'tis antique, and originally from France.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> It is always locked up, madam, when I'm in
the country. My father prizes it mightily.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> 'Twould make a very pretty dancing suit in
a masque. Oh! Captain Clerimont, I have a quarrel with
you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Your very humble servant.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> I am going to take the air this morning
in my coach, and did myself the honour, before
I went, to receive your commands, finding you saw
company.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> At any time when you know I do, you
may let me see you. Pray, how did you sleep last night?&mdash;If
I had not asked him that question they might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>

show me.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Then, madam, you have no commands this

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Your humble servant, sir&mdash;But, oh! [<i>As
she is going to be led by the Captain.</i>] Have you signed
that mortgage to pay off my Lady Faddle's winnings at

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Yes, madam.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Then all's well; my honour's safe. [<i>Exit</i>
<span class="smcap">Clerimont, Sen.</span>] Come, captain, lead me this step,
for I'm apt to make a false one; you shall show me.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> I'll show you, madam; 'tis no matter for a

tune. Pray, more quick&mdash;Oh, mademoiselle, que faites-vous?&mdash;A
moi&mdash;There again&mdash;Now slide, as it were,
with and without measure&mdash;There you outdid the
gipsy; and you have all the smiles of the dance to a
tittle.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Why, truly, I think that the greatest part.
I have seen an English woman dance a jig with the
severity of a vestal virgin.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> If this be French dancing and singing, I fancy
I could do it. Haw! haw! [<i>Capers aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> I protest, Mr. Gubbin, you have almost
the step, without any of our country bashfulness. Give
me your hand. Haw! haw! So, so; a little quicker.
That's right, haw!&mdash;Captain, your brother delivered this
spark to me, to be diverted here till he calls for him.

<p><i>Hump.</i> This cutting so high makes one's money jingle
confoundedly. I'm resolved I'll never carry above one
pocketful hereafter.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> You do it very readily; you amaze me.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Are the gentlemen in France generally so
well bred as we are in England? Are they, madam,
ha?&mdash;But, young gentleman, when shall I see this
sister? Haw! haw! haw! Is not the higher one
jumps the better?</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> She'll be mightily taken with you, I'm sure. One
would not think 'twas in you&mdash;you're so gay, and dance
so very high.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> What should ail me? Did you think I
was wind-galled? I can sing, too, if I please; but
I won't till I see your sister&mdash;This is a mighty pretty
house.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Well, do you know that I like this gentleman
extremely? I should be glad to inform him&mdash;But were
you never in France, Mr. Gubbin?</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> No; but I'm always thus pleasant, if my
father's not by.&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Fainlove</span>.] I protest I'd advise
your sister to have me: I'm for marrying her at once.
Why should I stand shilly-shally, like a country
bumpkin?</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> Mr. Gubbin, I daresay she'll be as forward as
you; we'll go in and see her. [<i>Apart.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Then he has not yet seen the lady he is in
love with! I protest very new and gallant&mdash;Mr. Gubbin,
she must needs believe you a frank person&mdash;Fainlove,

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Niece</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Oh, Clerimont! Clerimont! To be struck at
first sight! I'm ashamed of my weakness; I find in myself
all the symptoms of a raging amour. I love solitude,
I grow pale, I sigh frequently, I call upon the name of
Clerimont when I don't think of it&mdash;His person is ever in
my eyes, and his voice in my ears&mdash;Methinks I long to
lose myself in some pensive grove, or to hang over the
head of some warbling fountain, with a lute in my hand,
softening the murmurs of the water.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Biddy, Biddy; where's Biddy Tipkin?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Whom do you inquire for?</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Come, come; he's just a-coming at the Park
door.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Who is coming?</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Your cousin Humphry. Who should be
coming? Your lover, your husband that is to be&mdash;Pray,
my dear, look well, and be civil for your credit, and mine
too.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> If he answers my idea, I shall rally the rustic to
death.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Hist&mdash;Here he is.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Humphry</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Aunt, your humble servant. Is that&mdash;ha!
Aunt?</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Yes, cousin Humphry, that's your cousin
Bridget&mdash;Well, I'll leave you together.
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Aunt</span>. <i>They sit.</i></p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Aunt does as she'd be done by, cousin Bridget,
does not she, cousin? Ha! What, are you a Londoner,
and not speak to a gentleman? Look ye, cousin, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
old folks resolving to marry us, I thought it would be
proper to see how I liked you, as not caring to buy a pig
in a poke, for I love to look before I leap.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Sir, your person and address bring to my mind
the whole history of Valentine and Orson.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> What, would
they marry me to a wild man? Pray answer me a
question or two.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Ay, ay; as many as you please, cousin
Bridget.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> What wood were you taken in? How long
have you been caught?</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Caught!</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Where were your haunts?</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> My haunts!</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Are not clothes very uneasy to you? Is this
strange dress the first you ever wore?</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> How?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Are you not a great admirer of roots, and raw
flesh? Let me look upon your nails&mdash;Don't you love
blackberries, haws, and pig-nuts, mightily?</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> How?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Can'st thou deny that thou wert suckled by a
wolf? You have not been so barbarous, I hope, since
you came among men, as to hunt your nurse, have
you?</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Hunt my nurse? Ay, 'tis so, she's distracted,
as sure as a gun. Hark ye, cousin, pray will you let me
ask you a question or two?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> If thou hast yet learned the use of language,
speak, monster.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> How long have you been thus?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Thus! What would'st thou say?</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> What's the cause of it? Tell me truly, now;
did you never love anybody before me?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Go, go, thou'rt a savage. [<i>Rises.</i></p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> They never let you go abroad, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Thou'rt a monster, I tell thee.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Indeed, cousin, though 'tis a folly to tell thee
so&mdash;I am afraid thou art a mad woman.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> I'll have thee carried into some forest.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> I'll take thee into a dark room.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> I hate thee.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> I wish you did&mdash;There's no hate lost, I assure
you, cousin Bridget.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Cousin Bridget, quoth'a! I'd as soon claim
kindred with a mountain bear&mdash;I detest thee.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> You never do any harm in these fits, I hope.&mdash;But
do you hate me in earnest?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Dost thou ask it, ungentle forester?</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Yes; for I've a reason, look ye. It happens
very well if you hate me and are in your senses, for, to
tell you truly, I don't much care for you; and there is
another fine woman, as I am informed, that is in some
hopes of having me.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> This merits my attention. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Look ye, d'ye see&mdash;as I said, since I don't
care for you, I would not have you set your heart on me;
but if you like anybody else let me know it, and I'll find
out a way for us to get rid of one another, and deceive
the old folks that would couple us.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> This wears the face of an amour.&mdash;There is
something in that thought which makes thy presence less
insupportable.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Nay, nay, now you're growing fond; if
you come with these maid's tricks, to say you hate
at first and afterwards like me, you'll spoil the whole
design.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Don't fear it&mdash;When I think of consorting with
thee, may the wild boar defile the cleanly ermine; may
the tiger be wedded to the kid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> When I of thee, may the pole-cat caterwaul
with the civet.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> When I harbour the least thought of thee, may
the silver Thames forget its course.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> When I like thee, may I be soused over head
and ears in a horsepond&mdash;But do you hate me?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Aunt</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Niece.</i> For ever; and you me?</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Most heartily.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Ha! I like this. They are come to promises and
protestations. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> I am very glad I have found a way to please
you.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> You promise to be constant?</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Till death.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Thou best of savages!</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Thou best of savages! Poor Biddy.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Oh! the pretty couple, joking on one another&mdash;Well,
how do you like your cousin Humphry now?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Much better than I thought I should. He's
quite another thing than what I took him for&mdash;We have
both the same passion for one another.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> We wanted only an occasion to open our
hearts, aunt.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Oh, how this will rejoice my brother and Sir
Harry! we'll go to 'em.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> No, I must fetch a walk with a new acquaintance,
Mr. Samuel Pounce.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> An excellent acquaintance for your husband;
come, niece, come.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Farewell, rustic.</p>

<h3>ACT THE FOURTH.</h3>


<h4>SCENE.&mdash;<i>A Street.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Captain Clerimont</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Pounce</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Does she expect me then, at this
very instant?</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> I tell you, she ordered me
to bring the painter at this very hour,
precisely, to draw her niece; for, to
make her picture peculiarly charming,
she has now that downcast pretty
shame, that warm cheek, glowing with the fear and hope
of to-day's fate, with the inviting, coy affection of a bride,
all in her face at once. Now I know you are a pretender
that way.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Enough, I warrant, to personate the character
on such an inspiring occasion.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> You must have the song I spoke of performed
at this window, at the end of which I'll give you a signal.
Everything is ready for you; your pencil, your canvas
stretched, your&mdash;&mdash;Be sure you play your part in humour.
To be a painter for a lady, you're to have the excessive
flattery of a lover, the ready invention of a poet, and
the easy gesture of a player.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Come, come, no more instructions, my imagination
out-runs all you can say. Be gone, be gone! [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Pounce</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><span class="smcap">A Song</span>.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Why, lovely charmer, tell me why,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So very kind, and yet so shy?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Why does that cold forbidding air</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Give damps of sorrow and despair?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or why that smile my soul subdue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And kindle up my flames anew?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">II.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In vain you strive with all your art,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By turns to freeze and fire my heart:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When I behold a face so fair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So sweet a look, so soft an air,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My ravished soul is charmed all o'er,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I cannot love thee less nor more.</span><br />

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Captain, captain. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Captain</span>.</p>


<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Niece's</span> <i>Lodgings; two chairs and a table.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Aunt</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Niece</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Indeed, niece, I am as much overjoyed to see
your wedding day as if it were my own.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> But why must it be huddled up so?</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Oh, my dear, a private wedding is much better;
your mother had such a bustle at hers, with feasting and
fooling. Besides, they did not go to bed till two in the
morning.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Since you understand things so well, I wonder
you never married yourself.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> My dear, I was very cruel thirty years ago, and
nobody has asked me since.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Alas-a-day!</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Yet, I assure you, there was a great many
matches proposed to me: There was Sir Gilbert Jolly,
but he, forsooth, could not please; he drank ale and
smoked tobacco, and was no fine gentleman, forsooth&mdash;But
then, again, there was young Mr. Peregrine Shapely,
who had travelled, and spoke French, and smiled at all I
said; he was a fine gentleman&mdash;but then he was consumptive.
And yet again, to see how one may be mistaken;
Sir Jolly died in half-a-year, and my Lady
Shapely has by that thin slip eight children, that should
have been mine&mdash;but here's the bridegroom.&mdash;So, cousin
Humphry!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Humphry</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Your servant, ladies. So, my dear&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> So, my savage&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> O fie, no more of that to your husband,
Biddy.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> No matter, I like it as well as duck or love;
I know my cousin loves me as well as I do her.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> I'll leave you together; I must go and get ready
an entertainment for you when you come home. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Well, cousin, are you constant? Do you hate
me still?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> As much as ever.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> What an happiness it is, when peoples' inclinations
jump! I wish I knew what to do with you. Can
you get nobody, d'ye think, to marry you?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Oh! Clerimont, Clerimont! Where art thou?
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Aunt</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Captain Clerimont</span>, <i>disguised.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> This, sir, is the lady whom you are to draw.
You see, sir, as good flesh and blood as a man would
desire to put in colours&mdash;I must have her maiden picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Then the painter must make haste. Ha,
cousin!</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Hold thy tongue, good savage.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Madam, I'm generally forced to new-mould
every feature, and mend nature's handiwork; but here
she has made so finished an original, that I despair of my
copies coming up to it.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Do you hear that, niece?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> I don't desire you to make graces where you
find none.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> To see the difference of the fair sex! I protest
to you, madam, my fancy is utterly exhausted with inventing
faces for those that sit to me. The first entertainment
I generally meet with, are complaints for want
of sleep; they never looked so pale in their lives, as
when they sit for their pictures. Then so many touches
and retouches, when the face is finished. That wrinkle
ought not to have been, those eyes are too languid, that
colour's too weak, that side-look hides the mole on the
left cheek. In short, the whole likeness is struck out&mdash;But
in you, madam, the highest I can come up to will be
but rigid justice.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> A comical dog this!</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Truly, the gentleman seems to understand his
business.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Sir,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> if your pencil flatters like your tongue, you
are going to draw a picture that won't be at all like me&mdash;Sure
I have heard that voice somewhere. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Madam, be pleased to place yourself near me;
nearer still, madam, here falls the best light. You must
know, madam, there are three kinds of airs which the
ladies most delight in: There is your haughty, your
mild, and your pensive air. The haughty may be expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
with the head a little more erect than ordinary,
and the countenance with a certain disdain in it, so as
she may appear almost, but not quite, inexorable. This
kind of air is generally heightened with a little knitting
of the brows&mdash;I gave my lady Scornwell the choice
of a dozen frowns before she could find one to her
liking.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> But what's the mild air?</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> The mild air is composed of a languish, and a
smile&mdash;But, if I might advise, I'd rather be a pensive
beauty; the pensive usually feels her pulse, leans on one
arm, or sits ruminating with a book in her hand; which
conversation she is supposed to choose rather than the
endless importunities of lovers.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> A comical dog!</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Upon my word he understands his business
well; I'll tell you, niece, how your mother was drawn:
she had an orange in her hand,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and a nosegay in her
bosom, but a look so pure and fresh-coloured you'd have
taken her for one of the Seasons.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> You seem indeed, madam, most inclined to the
pensive. The pensive delights also in the fall of waters,
pastoral figures, or any rural view suitable to a fair lady
who, with a delicate spleen, has retired from the world, as
sick of its flattery and admiration.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> No; since there is room for fancy in a picture,
I would be drawn like the amazon Thalestris, with a
spear in my hand, and an helmet on a table before me.
At a distance behind let there be a dwarf, holding by the
bridle a milk-white palfrey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Madam, the thought is full of spirit, and if you
please, there shall be a Cupid stealing away your helmet,
to show that love should have a part in all gallant
actions.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> That circumstance may be very picturesque.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Here, madam, shall be your own picture, here
the palfrey, and here the dwarf&mdash;The dwarf must be
very little, or we shan't have room for him.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> A dwarf cannot be too little.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> I'll make him a blackamoor to distinguish him
from the other too powerful dwarf [<i>Sighs</i>]&mdash;the Cupid&mdash;I'll
place that beauteous boy near you, 'twill look very
natural&mdash;He'll certainly take you for his mother Venus.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> I leave these particulars to your own fancy.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i><a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Please, madam, to uncover your neck a little;
a little lower still&mdash;a little, little lower.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> I'll be drawn thus, if you please, sir.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Ladies, have you heard the news of a late marriage
between a young lady of great fortune and a
younger brother of a good family?</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Pray, sir, how is it?</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> This young gentleman, ladies, is a particular
acquaintance of mine, and much about my age and
stature (look me full in the face, madam); he accidentally
met the young lady, who had in her all the perfections
of her sex (hold up your head, madam, that's
right); she let him know that his person and discourse
were not altogether disagreeable to her. The difficulty
was how to gain a second interview (your eyes full
upon mine, madam); for never was there such a sigher in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
all the valleys of Arcadia as that unfortunate youth,
during the absence of her he loved.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Alack-a-day! poor young gentleman!</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> It must be he&mdash;what a charming amour is this!
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> At length, ladies, he bethought himself of an
expedient; he dressed himself just as I am now, and
came to draw her picture (your eyes full upon mine,
pray, madam).</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> A subtle dog, I warrant him.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> And by that means found an opportunity of
carrying her off, and marrying her.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Indeed, your friend was a very vicious young
man.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Yet perhaps the young lady was not displeased
at what he had done.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> But, madam, what were the transports of the
lover when she made him that confession?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> I daresay she thought herself very happy when
she got out of her guardian's hands.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> 'Tis very true, niece; there are abundance of
those headstrong young baggages about town.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> The gentleman has often told me, he was
strangely struck at first sight, but when she sat to him
for her picture, and assumed all those graces that are
proper for the occasion, his torment was so exquisite, his
passion so violent, that he could not have lived a day,
had he not found means to make the charmer of his
heart his own.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> 'Tis certainly the foolishest thing in the
world to stand shilly-shally about a woman, when one
has a mind to marry her.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> The young painter turned poet on the subject;
I believe I have the words by heart.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> A sonnet! pray repeat it.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">While gentle Parthenissa walks,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And sweetly smiles, and gaily talks,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A thousand shafts around her fly,</span><br />

</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> I fancy if 'twas sung, 'twould make a very
pretty catch.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> My servant has a voice; you shall hear it.
[<i>Here it is sung.</i></p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Why this is pretty! I think a painter should
never be without a good singer, it brightens the features
strangely&mdash;I profess I'm mightily pleased. I'll but just
step in, and give some orders, and be with you presently.
[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Was not this adventurous painter called Clerimont?</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> It was Clerimont, the servant of Parthenissa;
but let me beseech that beauteous maid to resolve, and
make the incident I feigned to her a real one. Consider,
madam, you are environed by cruel and treacherous
guards, which would force you to a disagreeable
marriage; your case is exactly the same with the princess
of the Leontines in <i>Clelia</i>.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> How can we commit such a solecism against all
rules? What, in the first leaf of our history to have the
marriage? You know it cannot be.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> The pleasantest part of the history will be after
marriage.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> No! I never yet read of a knight that entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
tilt or tournament after wedlock; 'tis not to be expected:
when the husband begins, the hero ends; all that noble
impulse to glory, all the generous passion for adventures,
is consumed in the nuptial torch; I don't know how it
is, but Mars and Hymen never hit it.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> [<i>Listening.</i>] Consumed in the nuptial torch!
Mars and Hymen! What can all this mean? I am very
glad I can hardly read. They could never get these
foolish fancies into my head, I had always a strong
brain [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Hark ye, cousin, is not this painter a
comical dog?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> I think he's very agreeable company.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Why then I tell you what: marry him&mdash;a
painter's a very genteel calling. He's an ingenious
fellow, and certainly poor. I fancy he'd be glad on't;
I'll keep my aunt out of the room a minute or two, that's
all the time you have to consider. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Fortune points out to us this only occasion of
our happiness: Love's of celestial origin, and needs no
long acquaintance to be manifest. Lovers, like angels,
speak by intuition; their souls are in their eyes.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Then I fear he sees mine. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;But I
can't think of abridging our amours, and cutting off all
farther decoration of disguise, serenade, and adventure.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Nor would I willingly lose the merit of long
services, midnight sighs, and plaintive solitudes, were
there not a necessity.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Then to be seized by stealth!</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Why, madam, you are a great fortune, and
should not be married the common way. Indeed,
madam, you ought to be stolen, nay, in strictness, I
don't know but you ought to be ravished.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> But then our history will be so short.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> I grant it; but you don't consider there's a device
in another's leading you instead of this person that's to
have you; and, madam, though our amours can't furnish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
out a romance, they'll make a very pretty novel&mdash;Why
smiles my fair?</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> I am almost of opinion that had Oroondates
been as pressing as Clerimont, Cassandra had been but
a pocket-book<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>; but it looks so ordinary, to go out at a
door to be married. Indeed, I ought to be taken out of
a window, and run away with.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Well, cousin, the coach is at the door. If you
please I'll lead you.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> I put myself into your hands, good savage; but
you promise to leave me.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> I tell you plainly, you must not think of having
me.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Cler.</span>] You'll have opportunity enough to
carry her off; the old fellows will be busy with me. I'll
gain all the time I can, but be bold and prosper.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> Clerimont, you follow us.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Upon the wings of love.</p>

<h3>ACT THE FIFTH.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Clerimont, Sen.'s</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Clerimont, Sen.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fainlove</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Then she gave you this
letter, and bid you read it as a paper
of verses?</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> This is the place, the hour,
the lucky minute. Now am I rubbing
up my memory, to recollect all
you said to me when you first ruined
me, that I may attack her right.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Your eloquence would be needless; 'tis so
unmodish to need persuasion: Modesty makes a lady
embarrassed; but my spouse is above that, as for example
[<i>Reading her letter</i>]&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Fainlove, you don't seem to
want wit; therefore I need say no more than that distance
to a woman of the world is becoming in no man
but a husband: an hour hence come up the back stairs
to my closet.</p>

<p>"Adieu, Mon Mignon."</p></blockquote>

<p>I am glad you are punctual; I'll conceal myself to
observe your interview.&mdash;O torture! but this wench
must not see it. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> Be sure you come time enough to save my
reputation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Remember your orders, "distance becomes
no man but a husband."</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> I am glad you are in so good humour on the
occasion; but you know me to be but a bully in love,
that can bluster only till the minute of engagement&mdash;but
I'll top my part, and form my conduct by my own
sentiments. If she grows coy, I'll grow more saucy&mdash;'twas
so I was won myself.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Well, my dear rival, your assignation draws
nigh; you are to put on your transport, your impatient
throbbing heart won't let you wait her arrival. Let the
dull family-thing and husband, who reckons his moments
by his cares, be content to wait; but you are a gallant,
and measure time by ecstasies.</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> I hear her coming&mdash;To your post&mdash;good husband,
know your duty, and don't be in the way when
your wife has a mind to be in private&mdash;To your post,
into the coal-hole.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Clerimont</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Welcome, my dear, my tender charmer, oh! to my
longing arms&mdash;feel the heart pant, that falls and rises as
you smile or frown. Oh, the ecstatic moment!&mdash;I think
that was something like what has been said to me.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Very well, Fainlove.&mdash;I protest I value
myself for my discerning. I knew you had fire through
all the respect you showed me; but how came you to
make no direct advances, young gentleman? Why was
I forced to admonish your gallantry?</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> Why, madam, I knew you a woman of breeding,
and above the senseless niceties of an English wife.
The French way is, you are to go so far, whether you are
agreeable or not. If you are so happy as to please,
nobody that is not of a constrained behaviour is at a loss
to let you know it&mdash;Besides, if the humble servant makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
the first approaches, he has the impudence of making a
request, but not the honour of obeying a command.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Right; a woman's man should conceal
passion in a familiar air of indifference. Now there's
Mr. Clerimont; I can't allow him the least freedom, but
the unfashionable fool grows so fond of me he cannot
hide it in public.</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> Ay, madam, I have often wondered at your
ladyship's choice of one that seems to have so little of
the beau monde in his carriage, but just what you force
him to, while there were so many pretty gentlemen&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Dancing.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Oh, young gentleman, you are mightily
mistaken, if you think such animals as you, and pretty
Beau Titmouse, and pert Billy Butterfly, though I suffer
you to come in, and play about my rooms, are any ways
in competition with a man whose name one would wear.</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> O madam! then I find we are&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> A woman of sense must have respect for
a man of that character; but alas! respect&mdash;what is
respect? Respect is not the thing. Respect has something
too solemn for soft moments&mdash;you things are
more proper for hours of dalliance.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> [<i>Peeping.</i>] How have I wronged this fine
lady! I find I am to be a cuckold out of her pure
esteem for me.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Besides, those fellows for whom we have
respect have none for us. I warrant on such an occasion
Clerimont would have ruffled a woman out of all form,
while you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> A good hint&mdash;now my cause comes on.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> Since then you allow us fitter for soft moments,
why do we misemploy 'em? Let me kiss that beauteous
hand and clasp that graceful frame.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> How, Fainlove! What, you don't design<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
to be impertinent&mdash;But my lips have a certain roughness
on 'em to-day, han't they?</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> [<i>Kissing.</i>] No, they are all softness; their
delicious sweetness is inexpressible. Here language
fails; let me applaud thy lips, not by the utterance, but
by the touch of mine.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Clerimont, Sen.</span>, <i>drawing his sword.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Ha, villain! Ravisher! Invader of my bed
and honour! draw.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> What means this insolence&mdash;this intrusion
into my privacy? What, do you come into my very
closet without knocking? Who put this into your
head?</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> My injuries have alarmed me, and I'll bear
no longer, but sacrifice your bravado, the author of 'em.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Oh! poor Mr. Fainlove! Must he die for
his complaisance and innocent freedoms with me? How
could you, if you might? Oh! the sweet youth!
What, fight Mr. Fainlove? What will the ladies say?</p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> Let me come at the intruder on ladies' private
hours. The unfashionable monster! I'll prevent all
future interruption from him&mdash;Let me come.
[<i>Drawing his sword.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Oh the brave pretty creature! Look at
his youth and innocence&mdash;he is not made for such
rough encounters. Stand behind me&mdash;Poor Fainlove!&mdash;There
is not a visit in town, sir, where you shall not be
displayed at full length for this intrusion. I banish you
for ever from my sight and bed.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> I obey you, madam, for distance is becoming
in no man but a husband [<i>Giving her the letter,
which she reads, and falls into a swoon.</i>]&mdash;I've gone too
far&mdash;[<i>Kissing her.</i>]&mdash;The impertinent was guilty of nothing
but what my indiscretion led her to. This is the first
kiss I've had these six weeks&mdash;but she awakes. Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
Jenny, you topped your part, indeed. Come to my
arms, thou ready, willing, fair one. Thou hast no
vanities, no niceties; but art thankful for every instant
of love that I bestow on thee. [<i>Embracing her.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> What, am I then abused? Is it a wench
then of his? Oh me! Was ever poor abused wife,
poor innocent lady, thus injured!
[<i>Runs and seizes</i> <span class="smcap">Fainlove's</span> <i>sword.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Oh the brave pretty creature! Hurt Mr.
Fainlove! Look at his youth, his innocence&mdash;Ha! ha!
[<i>Interposing.</i></p>

<p><i>Fain.</i> Have a care, have a care, dear sir&mdash;I know by
myself she'll have no mercy.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> I'll be the death of her; let me come on.
Stand from between us, Mr. Clerimont&mdash;I would not
hurt you. [<i>Pushing and crying.</i></p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Run, run, Jenny. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Jenny</span>.] [<i>Looks
at her upbraidingly before he speaks.</i>] Well, madam,
are these the innocent freedoms you claimed of
me? Have I deserved this? How has there been a
moment of yours ever interrupted with the real pangs
I suffer? The daily importunities of creditors, who
became so by serving your profuse vanities: did I ever
murmur at supplying any of your diversions, while I
believed 'em (as you call 'em) harmless? Must, then,
those eyes that used to glad my heart with their familiar
brightness hang down with guilt? Guilt has transformed
thy whole person; nay, the very memory of it&mdash;&mdash;Fly
from my growing passion!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> I cannot fly, nor bear it. Oh! look not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> What can you say? Speak quickly.
[<i>Offering to draw.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> I never saw you moved before. Don't
murder me impenitent; I'm wholly in your power as a
criminal, but remember I have been so in a tender regard.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> But how have you considered that regard?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Is it possible you can forgive what you
ensnared me into? Oh, look at me kindly! You know
I have only erred in my intention, nor saw my danger,
till, by this honest art, you had shown me what 'tis to
venture to the utmost limit of what is lawful. You laid
that train, I'm sure, to alarm, not to betray, my innocence.
Mr. Clerimont, scorn such baseness! Therefore
I kneel&mdash;I weep&mdash;I am convinced. [<i>Kneels.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Takes her up, embracing her.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Then kneel, and weep no more, my fairest&mdash;my
reconciled! Be so in a moment, for know I cannot
(without wringing my own heart) give you the least compunction.
Be in humour. It shall be your own fault if
ever there's a serious word more on this subject.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> I must correct every idea that rises in my
mind, and learn every gesture of my body anew&mdash;I
detest the thing I was.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> No, no; you must not do so. Our joy
and grief, honour and reproach, are the same; you must
slide out of your foppery by degrees, so that it may
appear your own act.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> But this wench!</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> She is already out of your way; you shall
see the catastrophe of her fate yourself. But still keep
up the fine lady till we go out of town; you may return
to it with as decent airs as you please.&mdash;And now I have
shown you your error, I'm in so good humour as to
repeat you a couplet on the occasion&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They only who gain minds, true laurels wear:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Tis less to conquer, than convince, the fair.</span><br />

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tipkin's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Pounce</span> <i>with papers; a table, chairs, pen, ink,
and paper.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> 'Tis a delight to gall these old rascals, and set
'em at variance about stakes, which I know neither of
'em will ever have possession of.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Tipkin</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Harry</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Do you design, Sir Harry, that they shall have an
estate in their own hands, and keep house themselves,
poor things?</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> No, no, sir, I know better; they shall go
down into the country, and live with me, not touch a
farthing of money; but, having all things necessary
provided, they shall go tame about the house, and
breed.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Well, Sir Harry, then considering that all human
things are subject to change, it behoves every man that
has a just sense of mortality to take care of his money.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> I don't know what you mean, brother.
What do you drive at, brother?</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> This instrument is executed by you, your son,
and my niece, which discharges me of all retrospects.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> It is confessed, brother; but what then?</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> All that remains is, that you pay me for the
young lady's twelve years' board, as also all other
charges, as wearing-apparel, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> What is this you say? Did I give you my
discharge from all retrospects, as you call it? and after
all do you come with this and t'other, and all that? I
find you are&mdash;I tell you, sir, to your face&mdash;I find you
are&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> I find too what you are, Sir Harry.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> What am I, sir? What am I?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Why, sir, you are angry.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Sir, I scorn your words; I am not angry.
Mr. Pounce is my witness; I am as gentle as a lamb.
Would it not make any flesh alive angry, to see a close
hunks come after all with a demand of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Mr. Pounce, pray inform Sir Harry in this point.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Indeed, Sir Harry, I must tell you plainly,
that Mr. Tipkin, in this, demands nothing but what he
may recover. For though this case may be considered
<i>multifariam</i>&mdash;that is to say, as 'tis usually, commonly,
<i>vicatim</i>, or vulgarly expressed&mdash;yet, I say, when we
only observe that the power is settled as the law requires,
<i>assensu patris</i>, by the consent of the father, that
circumstance imports you are well acquainted with the
advantages which accrue to your family by this alliance,
which corroborates Mr. Tipkin's demand, and avoids all
objections that can be made.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Why then, I find you are his adviser in all
this.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Look ye, Sir Harry, to show you I love to promote
among my clients a good understanding; though
Mr. Tipkin may claim four thousand pounds, I'll engage
for him, and I know him so well, that he shall take three
thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight pounds, four
shillings and eightpence farthing.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Indeed, Mr. Pounce, you are too hard upon me.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> You must consider a little, Sir Harry is your
brother.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Three thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight
pounds, four shillings and eightpence farthing! For
what, I say? For what, sir?</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> For what, sir! for what she wanted, sir; a fine
lady is always in want, sir&mdash;her very clothes would
come to that money in half the time.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Three thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight
pounds, four shillings and eighteenpence farthing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
clothes! Pray how many suits does she wear out in a
year?</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Oh! dear sir, a fine lady's clothes are not old
by being worn, but by being seen.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Well, I'll save her clothes for the future,
after I have got her into the country. I'll warrant her
she shall not appear more in this wicked town, where
clothes are worn out by sight&mdash;And as to what you
demand, I tell you, sir, 'tis extortion.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Sir Harry, do you accuse me of extortion?</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Yes, I say extortion.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Mr. Pounce, write down that; there are very
good laws provided against scandal and calumny&mdash;Loss
of reputation may tend to loss of money.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Item, "for having accused Mr. Tipkin of extortion."</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Nay, if you come to your items&mdash;look ye,
Mr. Tipkin, this is an inventory of such goods as were
left to my niece, Bridget, by her deceased father, and
which I expect shall be forthcoming at her marriage to my
son: Imprimis, "a golden locket of her mother's, with
something very ingenious in Latin on the inside of it";
item, "a couple of muskets, with two shoulder-belts and
bandoleers"; item, "a large silver caudle-cup, with a true
story engraven on it."</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> But, Sir Harry&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Item, "a bass viol, with almost all the
strings to it, and only a small hole on the back."</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> But nevertheless, sir&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> This is the furniture of my brother's bedchamber
that follows:&mdash;"A suite of tapestry hangings,
with the story of Judith and Holofernes, torn only where
the head should have been off; an old bedstead, curiously
wrought about the posts, consisting of two load of timber;
a hone, a basin, three razors, and a comb-case"&mdash;Look
ye, sir, you see I can item it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Alas, Sir Harry, if you had ten quire of items,
'tis all answered in the word retrospect.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Why then, Mr. Pounce and Mr. Tipkin, you
are both rascals.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Do you call me rascal, Sir Harry?</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Write it down, Mr. Pounce, at the end of the
leaf.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> If you have room, Mr. Pounce, put down
"villain, son of a whore, curmudgeon, hunks, and scoundrel."</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Not so fast, Sir Harry, he cannot write so fast;
you are at the word "villain"; "son of a whore," I take
it, was next&mdash;You may make the account as large as you
please, Sir Harry.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Come, come, I won't be used thus. Hark
ye, sirrah, draw&mdash;what do you do at this end of the town
without a sword? Draw, I say&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Sir Harry, you are a military man, a colonel of
the Militia.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> I am so, sirrah, and will run such an extorting
dog as you through the guts, to show the Militia is useful.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> O dear, O dear! How am I concerned to
see persons of your figure thus moved&mdash;The wedding is
coming in, we'll settle these things afterwards.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> I am calm.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Tipkin, live these two hours, but expect&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Humphry</span>, <i>leading</i> <span class="smcap">Niece; Mrs. Clerimont</span>, <i>led by</i>
<span class="smcap">Fainlove; Captain Clerimont</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Clerimont, Sen</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Who are these? Hey-day, who are these, Sir
Harry? Ha!</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Some frolic, 'tis wedding-day; no matter.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Haw! haw! father, master uncle, come, you
must stir your stumps, you must dance&mdash;Come, old lads,
kiss the ladies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Mr. Tipkin, Sir Harry, I beg pardon for
an introduction so malapropos; I know sudden familiarity
is not the English way. Alas, Mr. Gubbin, this father
and uncle of yours must be new modelled; how they
stare, both of them!</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Hark ye, Numps, who is this you have
brought hither? is it not the famous fine lady, Mrs. Clerimont?
What a pox did you let her come near your
wife?</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Look ye, don't expose yourself, and play some
mad country prank to disgrace me before her; I shall be
laughed at, because she knows I understand better.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> I congratulate, madam, your coming out of
the bondage of a virgin state. A woman can't do what
she will properly till she's married.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Did you hear what she said to your wife?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Aunt</span>, <i>before a service of Dishes.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> So, Mr. Bridegroom, pray take that napkin,
and serve your spouse to-day, according to custom.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Mrs. Clerimont, pray know my aunt.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Madam, I must beg your pardon; I can't
possibly like all that vast load of meat that you are
sending in to table, besides, 'tis so offensively sweet, it
wants that haut-goût we are so delighted with in France.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> You'll pardon it, since we did not expect you&mdash;Who
is this? [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Oh, madam, I only speak for the future;
little saucers are so much more polite. Look ye, I'm
perfectly for the French way; where'er I'm admitted, I
take the whole upon me.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> The French, madam, I'd have you to
know&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> You'll not like it at first, out of a natural
English sullenness, but that will come upon you by
degrees. When I first went into France I was mortally
afraid of a frog, but in a little time I could eat nothing
else, except salads.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> Eat frogs! have I kissed one that has ate frogs?
Paw! paw!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cler.</i> Oh, madam, a frog and a salad are delicious
fare; 'tis not long come up in France itself, but their
glorious monarch has introduced the diet which makes
'em so spiritual. He eradicated all gross food by taxes,
and, for the glory of the monarch, sent the subject a-grazing&mdash;but
I fear I defer the entertainment and diversion
of the day.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Now father, uncle, before we go any further, I
think 'tis necessary we know who and who's together;
then I give either of you two hours to guess which is my
wife&mdash;and 'tis not my cousin; so far I'll tell you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> How! What do you say? But oh! you
mean she is not your cousin now, she's nearer akin; that's
well enough. Well said, Numps; ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> No, I don't mean so; I tell you I don't mean
so&mdash;My wife hides her face under her hat.
[<i>All looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Fainlove</span>.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> What does the puppy mean? His wife under a
hat!</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Ay, ay, that's she, that's she&mdash;A good jest,
'faith!</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Hark ye, Numps, what dost mean, child?
Is that a woman, and are you really married to her?</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> I am sure of both.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Are you so, sirrah? then, sirrah, this is your
wedding dinner, sirrah&mdash;Do you see, sirrah, here's roast
meat.</p>

<p><i>Hump.</i> Oh, oh! what, beat a married man! Hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
him, Mr. Clerimont, Brother Pounce, Mr. Wife; nobody
stand by a young married man!
[<i>Runs behind</i> <span class="smcap">Fainlove</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Did not the dog say Brother Pounce? what,
is this Mrs. Ragout? this Madam Clerimont? Who the
devil are you all? but especially who the devil are you
two?
[<i>Beats</i> <span class="smcap">Humphry</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fainlove</span> <i>off the Stage, following.</i></p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Pounce.</span>] Master Pounce, all my niece's fortune
will be demanded now&mdash;for I suppose that red coat
has her. Don't you think you and I had better break?</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Tipkin.</span>] You may as soon as you please,
but 'tis my interest to be honest a little longer.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Well, Biddy, since you would not accept of your
cousin, I hope you han't disposed of yourself elsewhere.</p>

<p><i>Niece.</i> If you'll for a little while suspend your curiosity,
you shall have the whole history of my amour to this my
nuptial day, under the title of the loves of Clerimont and
Parthenissa.</p>

<p><i>Tip.</i> Then, madam, your portion is in safe hands.</p>

<p><i>Cler.</i> Come, come, old gentleman, 'tis in vain to contend;
here's honest Mr. Pounce shall be my engineer,
and I warrant you we beat you out of all your holds.</p>

<p><i>Aunt.</i> What then, is Mr. Pounce a rogue?&mdash;He must
have some trick, brother, it cannot be; he must have
cheated t'other side, for I'm sure he's honest.
[<i>Apart to</i> <span class="smcap">Tipkin</span>.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Mr. Pounce, all your sister has won of this
lady she has honestly put into my hands; and I'll return
it her, at this lady's particular request.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> And the thousand pounds you promised in
your brother's behalf, I'm willing should be hers also.</p>

<p><i>Cler. Sen.</i> Then go in, and bring 'em all back to make
the best of an ill game; we'll eat the dinner and have a
dance together, or we shall transgress all form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fainlove, Humphry</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Harry</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Well, since you say you are worth something,
and the boy has set his heart upon you, I'll have
patience till I see further.</p>

<p><i>Pounce.</i> Come, come, Sir Harry, you shall find my
alliance more considerable than you imagine; the Pounces
are a family that will always have money, if there's any
in the world&mdash;Come, fiddles.</p>

<p><i>The Conscious Lovers</i>, a Comedy which
had been long in preparation, was acted
at Drury Lane Theatre on November
7, 1722, "with new scenes and all
the characters new drest," and with
Booth (who had acted the part of
Pamphilus&mdash;the prototype of young
Bevil&mdash;at Westminster with great success), Wilks
(Myrtle), Cibber (Tom), Mills (Sir John Bevil), Mrs.
Oldfield (Indiana), and Mrs. Younger (Phillis) in the
principal parts. The play ran for eighteen nights, and
was a great success. It was often revived between 1722
and 1760, and was acted at Covent Garden in 1810, and
at Bath in 1818. Phillis was Peg Woffington's second
speaking character in Dublin, and she took that part on
March 9, 1741, during her first season in London. The
play was published by Tonson on December 1, 1722,
with the date 1723 on the title-page. The general idea
of the piece is taken from Terence's <i>Andria</i>, but the original
is widely departed from after the opening scenes.
Colley Cibber lent material aid in preparing the play for
representation. It was attacked by John Dennis in two
pamphlets, and defended by Benjamin Victor and others.</p>

<h4><i>To</i></h4>

<h3>THE KING.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">May it please your Majesty</span>,</p>

<p>After having aspired to the highest and
most laudable ambition, that of following
the cause of liberty, I should not
have humbly petitioned your Majesty
for a direction of the theatre, had I not
believed success in that province an
happiness much to be wished by an
honest man, and highly conducing to the prosperity of
the commonwealth. It is in this view I lay before your
Majesty a Comedy which the audience, in justice to
themselves, has supported and encouraged, and is the
prelude of what, by your Majesty's influence and favour,
may be attempted in future representations.</p>

<p>The imperial mantle, the royal vestment, and the shining
diadem are what strike ordinary minds; but your
Majesty's native goodness, your passion for justice, and
her constant assessor mercy, is what continually surrounds
you in the view of intelligent spirits, and gives hope to
the suppliant, who sees he has more than succeeded in
giving your Majesty an opportunity of doing good. Our
King is above the greatness of royalty, and every act of
his will which makes another man happy has ten times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
more charms in it than one that makes himself appear
raised above the condition of others. But even this carries
unhappiness with it; for calm dominion, equal grandeur,
and familiar greatness do not easily affect the
imagination of the vulgar, who cannot see power but in
terror; and as fear moves mean spirits, and love prompts
great ones to obey, the insinuations of malcontents are
directed accordingly; and the unhappy people are ensnared,
from want of reflection, into disrespectful ideas of
their gracious and amiable sovereign, and then only
begin to apprehend the greatness of their master when
they have incurred his displeasure.</p>

<p>As your Majesty was invited to the throne of a willing
people, for their own sakes, and has ever enjoyed it with
contempt of the ostentation of it, we beseech you to protect
us who revere your title as we love your person. 'Tis
to be a savage to be a rebel, and they who have fallen
from you have not so much forfeited their allegiance as
lost their humanity. And, therefore, if it were only to
preserve myself from the imputation of being amongst
the insensible and abandoned, I would beg permission
in the most public manner possible to profess myself,
with the utmost sincerity and zeal,</p>

<p>Sire,</p>

<p>Your Majesty's</p>

<p>Most devoted subject</p>

<p>And servant,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard Steele</span>.</p>

<h3>THE PREFACE.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></h3>


<p>This Comedy has been received with
universal acceptance, for it was in
every part excellently performed;
and there needs no other applause
of the actors but that they excelled
according to the dignity and difficulty
of the character they represented.
But this great favour done to the work in acting
renders the expectation still the greater from the author,
to keep up the spirit in the representation of the closet,
or any other circumstance of the reader, whether alone
or in company; to which I can only say that it must be
remembered, a play is to be seen, and is made to be
represented with the advantage of action, nor can appear
but with half the spirit without it. For the greatest effect
of a play in reading is to excite the reader to go to see
it; and when he does so, it is then a play has the effect
of example and precept.</p>

<p>The chief design of this was to be an innocent performance,
and the audience have abundantly shown how
ready they are to support what is visibly intended that
way. Nor do I make any difficulty to acknowledge that
the whole was writ for the sake of the scene of the
Fourth Act, wherein Mr. Bevil evades the quarrel with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
his friend, and<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> hope it may have some effect upon the
Goths and Vandals that frequent the theatres, or a more
polite audience may supply their absence.</p>

<p>But this incident, and the case of the father and daughter,
are esteemed by some people no subjects of comedy; but
I cannot be of their mind, for anything that has its foundation
in happiness and success must be allowed to be the
object of comedy; and sure it must be an improvement of
it to introduce a joy too exquisite for laughter, that can
have no spring but in delight, which is the case of this
young lady. I must, therefore, contend that the tears which
were shed on that occasion flowed from reason and good
sense, and that men ought not to be laughed at for
weeping till we are come to a more clear notion of what
is to be imputed to the hardness of the head and the
softness of the heart; and I think it was very politely
said of Mr. Wilks, to one who told him there was a
General<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> weeping for Indiana, "I'll warrant he'll fight ne'er
the worse for that." To be apt to give way to the impressions
of humanity, is the excellence of a right disposition
and the natural working of a well-turned spirit. But as
I have suffered by critics who have got no farther than to
inquire whether they ought to be pleased or not,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> I
would willingly find them properer matter for their employment,
and revive here a song which was omitted for
want of a performer, and designed for the entertainment
of Indiana. Signor Carbonelli,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> instead of it, played<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
on the fiddle, and it is for want of a singer that such
advantageous things are said of an instrument which
were designed for a voice. The song is the distress of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
love-sick maid, and may be a fit entertainment for some
small critics<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> to examine whether the passion is just or
the distress male or female.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From place to place forlorn I go,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">With downcast eyes a silent shade,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Forbidden to declare my woe;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To speak till spoken to, afraid.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">II.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My inward pangs, my secret grief,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">My soft consenting looks betray.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He loves, but gives me no relief;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Why speaks not he who may?</span><br />
</p>

<p>It remains to say a word concerning Terence, and I
am extremely surprised to find what Mr. Cibber told
me prove a truth:<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> that what I valued myself so much
upon&mdash;the translation of him<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>&mdash;should be imputed to
me as a reproach. Mr. Cibber's zeal for the work, his
care and application in instructing the actors and altering
the disposition of the scenes, when I was, through
sickness, unable to cultivate such things myself, has been
a very obliging favour and friendship to me. For this
reason I was very hardly persuaded<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> to throw away
Terence's celebrated funeral, and take only the bare
authority of the young man's character; and how I have
worked it into an Englishman, and made use of the same
circumstances of discovering a daughter when we least
hoped for one, is humbly submitted to the learned reader.</p>

<h3><i>THE CONSCIOUS LOVERS.</i></h3>


<h3>ACT THE FIRST.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir John Bevil's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sir John Bevil</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Humphry</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Have you ordered that I
should not be interrupted while I am
dressing?</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Yes, sir; I believed you
had something of moment to say to me.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Let me see, Humphry;
I think it is now full forty years since I first took thee
to be about myself.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> I thank you, sir, it has been an easy forty years;
and I have passed 'em without much sickness, care, or
labour.</p>

<p><i>Sir J Bev.</i> Thou hast a brave constitution; you are a
year or two older than I am, sirrah.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> You have ever been of that mind, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> You knave, you know it; I took thee for
thy gravity and sobriety, in my wild years.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Ah, sir! our manners were formed from our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
different fortunes, not our different age. Wealth gave a
loose to your youth, and poverty put a restraint upon
mine.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Well, Humphry, you know I have been
a kind master to you; I have used you, for the ingenuous
nature I observed in you from the beginning, more like
an humble friend than a servant.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> I humbly beg you'll be so tender of me as
to explain your commands, sir, without any farther
preparation.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> I'll tell thee, then: In the first place,
this wedding of my son's in all probability&mdash;shut the door&mdash;will
never be at all.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> How, sir! not be at all? for what reason is
it carried on in appearance?</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Honest Humphry, have patience; and
I'll tell thee all in order. I have, myself, in some part
of my life, lived (indeed) with freedom, but, I hope,
without reproach. Now, I thought liberty would be as
little injurious to my son; therefore, as soon as he grew
towards man, I indulged him in living after his own
manner. I knew not how, otherwise, to judge of his
inclination; for what can be concluded from a behaviour
under restraint and fear?<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> But what charms me above
all expression is, that my son has never, in the least action,
the most distant hint or word, valued himself upon that
great estate of his mother's, which, according to our
marriage settlement, he has had ever since he came
to age.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> No, sir; on the contrary, he seems afraid of
appearing to enjoy it, before you or any belonging to
you. He is as dependent and resigned to your will as
if he had not a farthing but what must come from your
immediate bounty. You have ever acted like a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
and generous father, and he like an obedient and grateful
son.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Nay, his carriage is so easy to all with
whom he converses, that he is never assuming, never
prefers himself to others, nor ever is guilty of that rough
sincerity which a man is not called to, and certainly disobliges
most of his acquaintance; to be short, Humphry,
his reputation was so fair in the world, that old Sealand,
the great India merchant, has offered his only daughter,
and sole heiress to that vast estate of his, as a wife for
him. You may be sure I made no difficulties, the match
was agreed on, and this very day named for the wedding.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> What hinders the proceeding?</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Don't interrupt me. You know I was last
Thursday at the masquerade; my son, you may remember,
soon found us out. He knew his grandfather's habit,
which I then wore; and though it was the mode, in the
last age, yet the masquers, you know, followed us as if
we had been the most monstrous figures in that whole
assembly.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> I remember, indeed, a young man of quality
in the habit of a clown, that was particularly troublesome.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Right; he was too much what he seemed
to be. You remember how impertinently he followed and
teased us, and would know who we were.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> I know he has a mind to come into that
particular. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Ay, he followed us till the gentleman who
led the lady in the Indian mantle presented that gay creature
to the rustic, and bid him (like Cymon in the fable)
grow polite by falling in love, and let that worthy old
gentleman alone, meaning me. The clown was not
reformed, but rudely persisted, and offered to force off
my mask; with that, the gentleman, throwing off his own,
appeared to be my son, and in his concern for me, tore
off that of the nobleman; at this they seized each other;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
the company called the guards, and in the surprise the
lady swooned away; upon which my son quitted his
adversary, and had now no care but of the lady. When
raising her in his arms, "Art thou gone," cried he, "for
ever?&mdash;forbid it, Heaven!" She revived at his known
voice, and with the most familiar, though modest, gesture,
hangs in safety over his shoulder weeping, but wept as in
the arms of one before whom she could give herself a
loose, were she not under observation; while she hides
her face in his neck, he carefully conveys her from the
company.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> I have observed this accident has dwelt upon
you very strongly.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Her uncommon air, her noble modesty, the
dignity of her person, and the occasion itself, drew the
whole assembly together; and I soon heard it buzzed
about she was the adopted daughter of a famous sea-officer
who had served in France. Now this unexpected
and public discovery of my son's so deep concern for
her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Was what, I suppose, alarmed Mr. Sealand,
in behalf of his daughter, to break off the match?</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> You are right. He came to me yesterday
and said he thought himself disengaged from the bargain;
being credibly informed my son was already married, or
worse, to the lady at the masquerade. I palliated
matters, and insisted on our agreement; but we parted
with little less than a direct breach between us.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Well, sir; and what notice have you taken of
all this to my young master?</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> That's what I wanted to debate with you.
I have said nothing to him yet&mdash;but look you, Humphry,
if there is so much in this amour of his, that he
denies upon my summons to marry, I have cause enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
to be offended; and then by my insisting upon his marrying
to-day, I shall know how far he is engaged to this
lady in masquerade, and from thence only shall be able
to take my measures. In the meantime I would have
you find out how far that rogue, his man, is let into his
secret. He, I know, will play tricks as much to cross me,
as to serve his master.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Why do you think so of him, sir? I believe
he is no worse than I was for you, at your son's age.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> I see it in the rascal's looks. But I have
dwelt on these things too long; I'll go to my son immediately,
and while I'm gone, your part is to convince
his rogue, Tom, that I am in earnest.&mdash;I'll leave him to
you. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Sir John Bevil</span>.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Well, though this father and son live as well
together as possible, yet their fear of giving each other
pain is attended with constant mutual uneasiness. I'm
sure I have enough to do to be honest, and yet keep well
with them both. But they know I love 'em, and that
makes the task less painful however. Oh, here's the
prince of poor coxcombs, the representative of all the
better fed than taught. Ho! ho! Tom, whither so gay
and so airy this morning?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, <i>singing.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Sir, we servants of single gentlemen are another
kind of people than you domestic ordinary drudges that
do business; we are raised above you. The pleasures
of board-wages, tavern dinners, and many a clear gain;
vails, alas! you never heard or dreamt of.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Thou hast follies and vices enough for a man
of ten thousand a year, though 'tis but as t'other day that
I sent for you to town to put you into Mr. Sealand's
family, that you might learn a little before I put you to
my young master, who is too gentle for training such a
rude thing as you were into proper obedience. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
then pulled off your hat to everyone you met in the street,
like a bashful great awkward cub as you were. But your
great oaken cudgel, when you were a booby, became you
much better than that dangling stick at your button, now
you are a fop. That's fit for nothing, except it hangs
there to be ready for your master's hand when you are
impertinent.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Uncle Humphry, you know my master scorns
to strike his servants. You talk as if the world was now
just as it was when my old master and you were in your
youth; when you went to dinner because it was so much
o'clock, when the great blow was given in the hall at the
pantry door, and all the family came out of their holes
in such strange dresses and formal faces as you see in
the pictures in our long gallery in the country.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Why, you wild rogue!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> You could not fall to your dinner till a formal
fellow in a black gown said something over the meat, as
if the cook had not made it ready enough.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Sirrah, who do you prate after? Despising
men of sacred characters! I hope you never heard my
good young master talk so like a profligate.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Sir, I say you put upon me, when I first came
to town, about being orderly, and the doctrine of wearing
shams to make linen last clean a fortnight, keeping my
clothes fresh, and wearing a frock within doors.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Sirrah, I gave you those lessons because I
supposed at that time your master and you might have
dined at home every day, and cost you nothing; then you
might have made a good family servant. But the gang
you have frequented since at chocolate houses and
taverns, in a continual round of noise and extravagance&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I don't know what you heavy inmates call noise
and extravagance; but we gentlemen, who are well fed,
and cut a figure, sir, think it a fine life, and that we must
be very pretty fellows who are kept only to be looked at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Very well, sir, I hope the fashion of being lewd
and extravagant, despising of decency and order, is almost
at an end, since it has arrived at persons of your quality.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Master Humphry, ha! ha! you were an unhappy
lad to be sent up to town in such queer days as you
were. Why, now, sir, the lackeys are the men of pleasure
of the age, the top gamesters; and many a laced coat
about town have had their education in our party-coloured
regiment. We are false lovers; have a taste of
music, poetry, billet-doux, dress, politics; ruin damsels;
and when we are tired of this lewd town, and have a
mind to take up, whip into our masters' wigs and linen,
and marry fortunes.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Hey-day!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Nay, sir, our order is carried up to the highest
dignities and distinctions; step but into the Painted
Chamber,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> and by our titles you'd take us all for men of
quality. Then, again, come down to the Court of Requests,
and you see us all laying our broken heads together for
the good of the nation; and though we never carry a
question nemine contradicente, yet this I can say, with a
safe conscience (and I wish every gentleman of our cloth
could lay his hand upon his heart and say the same), that
I never took so much as a single mug of beer for my vote
in all my life.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Sirrah, there is no enduring your extravagance;
I'll hear you prate no longer. I wanted to see
you to enquire how things go with your master, as far as
you understand them; I suppose he knows he is to be
married to-day.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Ay, sir, he knows it, and is dressed as gay as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
the sun; but, between you and I, my dear, he has a
very heavy heart under all that gaiety. As soon as he
was dressed I retired, but overheard him sigh in the most
heavy manner. He walked thoughtfully to and fro in
the room, then went into his closet; when he came out
he gave me this for his mistress, whose maid, you
know&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Is passionately fond of your fine person.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> The poor fool is so tender, and loves to hear me
talk of the world, and the plays, operas, and ridottos<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> for
the winter, the parks and Belsize<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> for our summer diversions;
and "Lard!" says she, "you are so wild, but you
have a world of humour."</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Coxcomb! Well, but why don't you run
with your master's letter to Mrs. Lucinda, as he ordered
you?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Because Mrs. Lucinda is not so easily come at
as you think for.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Not easily come at? Why, sirrah, are not her
father and my old master agreed that she and Mr. Bevil
are to be one flesh before to-morrow morning?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> It's no matter for that; her mother, it seems,
Mrs. Sealand, has not agreed to it; and you must
know, Mr. Humphry, that in that family the grey mare
is the better horse.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> What dost thou mean?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> In one word, Mrs. Sealand pretends to have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
will of her own, and has provided a relation of hers, a
stiff, starched philosopher, and a wise fool, for her daughter;
for which reason, for these ten days past, she has
suffered no message nor letter from my master to come
near her.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> And where had you this intelligence?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> From a foolish fond soul that can keep nothing
from me; one that will deliver this letter too, if she
is rightly managed.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> What! her pretty handmaid, Mrs. Phillis?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Even she, sir; this is the very hour, you know,
she usually comes hither, under a pretence of a visit to
your housekeeper, forsooth, but in reality to have a glance
at&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Your sweet face, I warrant you.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Nothing else in nature; you must know, I love
to fret and play with the little wanton.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Play with the little wanton! What will this
world come to!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I met her this morning in a new manteau and
petticoat, not a bit the worse for her lady's wearing;
and she has always new thoughts and new airs with new
clothes&mdash;then she never fails to steal some glance or
gesture from every visitant at their house; and is, indeed,
the whole town of coquets at second-hand. But here she
comes; in one motion she speaks and describes herself
better than all the words in the world can.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Then I hope, dear sir, when your own affair
is over, you will be so good as to mind your master's
with her.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Dear Humphry, you know my master is my
friend, and those are people I never forget.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Sauciness itself! but I'll leave you to do
your best for him. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Phillis</span>.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Oh, Mr. Thomas, is Mrs. Sugar-key at home?
Lard, one is almost ashamed to pass along the streets!
The town is quite empty, and nobody of fashion left in
it; and the ordinary people do so stare to see anything,
dressed like a woman of condition, as it were on the
same floor with them, pass by. Alas! alas! it is a sad
thing to walk. O fortune! fortune!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> What! a sad thing to walk? Why, Madam
Phillis, do you wish yourself lame?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> No, Mr. Tom, but I wish I were generally
carried in a coach or chair, and of a fortune neither to
stand nor go, but to totter, or slide, to be short-sighted,
or stare, to fleer in the face, to look distant, to observe,
to overlook, yet all become me; and, if I was rich, I
could twire<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and loll as well as the best of them. Oh,
Tom! Tom! is it not a pity that you should be so great
a coxcomb, and I so great a coquet, and yet be such
poor devils as we are?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Mrs. Phillis, I am your humble servant for
that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Yes, Mr. Thomas, I know how much you are
my humble servant, and know what you said to Mrs.
Judy, upon seeing her in one of her lady's cast manteaus:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
That any one would have thought her the lady, and that
she had ordered the other to wear it till it sat easy; for
now only it was becoming. To my lady it was only a
covering, to Mrs. Judy it was a habit. This you said,
after somebody or other. Oh, Tom! Tom! thou art as
false and as base as the best gentleman of them all; but,
you wretch, talk to me no more on the old odious subject&mdash;don't,
I say.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I know not how to resist your commands,
madam. [<i>In a submissive tone, retiring.</i></p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Commands about parting are grown mighty easy
to you of late.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Oh, I have her; I have nettled and put her
into the right temper to be wrought upon and set a-prating.
[<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Why, truly, to be plain with you, Mrs.
Phillis, I can take little comfort of late in frequenting
your house.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Pray, Mr. Thomas, what is it all of a sudden
offends your nicety at our house?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I don't care to speak particulars, but I dislike
the whole.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> I thank you, sir, I am a part of that whole.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Mistake me not, good Phillis.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Good Phillis! Saucy enough. But however&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I say, it is that thou art a part, which gives me
pain for the disposition of the whole. You must know,
madam, to be serious, I am a man, at the bottom, of
prodigious nice honour. You are too much exposed to
company at your house. To be plain, I don't like so
many, that would be your mistress's lovers, whispering to
you.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Don't think to put that upon me. You say this,
because I wrung you to the heart when I touched your
guilty conscience about Judy.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Ah, Phillis! Phillis! if you but knew my heart!</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> I know too much on't.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Nay, then, poor Crispo's<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> fate and mine are
one. Therefore give me leave to say, or sing at least, as
he does upon the same occasion&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Se vedette," &amp;c. [<i>Sings.</i>]</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> What, do you think I'm to be fobbed off with a
song? I don't question but you have sung the same to
Mrs. Judy too.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Don't disparage your charms, good Phillis, with
jealousy of so worthless an object; besides, she is a poor
hussy, and if you doubt the sincerity of my love, you
will allow me true to my interest. You are a fortune,
Phillis.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> What would the fop be at now? In good time,
indeed, you shall be setting up for a fortune!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Dear Mrs. Phillis, you have such a spirit that
we shall never be dull in marriage when we come together.
But I tell you, you are a fortune, and you have
an estate in my hands. [<i>He pulls out a purse, she eyes it.</i></p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> What pretence have I to what is in your hands,
Mr. Tom?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> As thus: there are hours, you know, when a
lady is neither pleased or displeased; neither sick or well;
when she lolls or loiters; when she's without desires&mdash;from
having more of everything than she knows what to
do with.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Well, what then?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> When she has not life enough to keep her
bright eyes quite open, to look at her own dear image in
the glass.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Explain thyself, and don't be so fond of thy own
prating.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> There are also prosperous and good-natured
moments: as when a knot or a patch is happily fixed;
when the complexion particularly flourishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Well, what then? I have not patience!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Why, then&mdash;or on the like occasions&mdash;we servants
who have skill to know how to time business, see
when such a pretty folded thing as this [<i>Shows a letter.</i>]
may be presented, laid, or dropped, as best suits the
present humour. And, madam, because it is a long
wearisome journey to run through all the several stages
of a lady's temper, my master, who is the most reasonable
man in the world, presents you this to bear your
charges on the road. [<i>Gives her the purse.</i></p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Now you think me a corrupt hussy.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> O fie, I only think you'll take the letter.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Nay, I know you do, but I know my own innocence;
I take it for my mistress's sake.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I know it, my pretty one, I know it.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Yes, I say I do it, because I would not have my
mistress deluded by one who gives no proof of his
passion; but I'll talk more of tips as you see me on my
way home. No, Tom, I assure thee, I take this trash of
thy master's, not for the value of the thing, but as it convinces
me he has a true respect for my mistress. I
remember a verse to the purpose&mdash;</p>

<p>

<h4>SCENE II. <span class="smcap">Bevil, Jun.'s</span> <i>Lodgings.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Bevil, Jun.</span>, <i>reading.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> These moral writers practise virtue after
death. This charming vision of Mirza!<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
author consulted in a morning sets the spirit for the
vicissitudes of the day better than the glass does a man's
person. But what a day have I to go through! to put
on an easy look with an aching heart! If this lady my
father urges me to marry should not refuse me, my
dilemma is insupportable. But why should I fear it?
Is not she in equal distress with me? Has not the
letter I have sent her this morning confessed my inclination
to another? Nay, have I not moral assurances of
her engagements, too, to my friend Myrtle? It's impossible
but she must give in to it; for, sure, to be
denied is a favour any man may pretend to. It must be
so&mdash;Well, then, with the assurance of being rejected, I
think I may confidently say to my father, I am ready to
marry her. Then let me resolve upon, what I am not
very good at, though it is an honest dissimulation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Sir John Bevil, sir, is in the next room.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Dunce! Why did not you bring him in?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I told him, sir, you were in your closet.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> I thought you had known, sir, it was my
duty to see my father anywhere.
[<i>Going himself to the door.</i></p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> The devil's in my master! he has always more
wit than I have. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Bevil, Jun.</span>, <i>introducing</i> <span class="smcap">Sir John</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Sir, you are the most gallant, the most complaisant
of all parents. Sure, 'tis not a compliment to
say these lodgings are yours. Why would you not walk
in, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> I was loth to interrupt you unseasonably
on your wedding-day.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> One to whom I am beholden for my birth-day
might have used less ceremony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Well, son, I have intelligence you have
writ to your mistress this morning. It would please my
curiosity to know the contents of a wedding-day letter;
for courtship must then be over.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> I assure you, sir, there was no insolence in
it upon the prospect of such a vast fortune's being added
to our family; but much acknowledgment of the lady's
greater desert.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> But, dear Jack, are you in earnest in all
this? And will you really marry her?</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Did I ever disobey any command of yours,
sir? nay, any inclination that I saw you bent upon?</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Why, I can't say you have, son; but methinks
in this whole business, you have not been so warm
as I could have wished you. You have visited her, it's
true, but you have not been particular. Everyone
knows you can say and do as handsome things as any
man; but you have done nothing but lived in the
general&mdash;been complaisant only.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> As I am ever prepared to marry if you bid
me, so I am ready to let it alone if you will have me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Humphry</span> <i>enters, unobserved.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Look you there now! why, what am I to
think of this so absolute and so indifferent a resignation?</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Think? that I am still your son, sir. Sir,
you have been married, and I have not. And you have,
sir, found the inconvenience there is when a man weds
with too much love in his head. I have been told, sir,
that at the time you married, you made a mighty bustle
on the occasion. There was challenging and fighting,
scaling walls, locking up the lady, and the gallant under
an arrest for fear of killing all his rivals. Now, sir, I
suppose you having found the ill consequences of these
strong passions and prejudices, in preference of one
woman to another, in case of a man's becoming a
widower&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> How is this?</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> I say, sir, experience has made you wiser in
your care of me; for, sir, since you lost my dear mother,
your time has been so heavy, so lonely, and so tasteless,
that you are so good as to guard me against the like unhappiness,
by marrying me prudentially by way of bargain
and sale. For, as you well judge, a woman that is
espoused for a fortune, is yet a better bargain if she
dies; for then a man still enjoys what he did marry, the
money, and is disencumbered of what he did not marry,
the woman.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> But pray, sir, do you think Lucinda, then,
a woman of such little merit?</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Pardon me, sir, I don't carry it so far
neither; I am rather afraid I shall like her too well;
she has, for one of her fortune, a great many needless
and superfluous good qualities.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> I am afraid, son, there's something I
don't see yet, something that's smothered under all this
raillery.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Not in the least, sir. If the lady is dressed
and ready, you see I am. I suppose the lawyers are
ready too.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> This may grow warm if I don't interpose.
[<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Sir, Mr. Sealand is at the coffee-house, and has
sent to speak with you.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Oh! that's well! Then I warrant the
lawyers are ready. Son, you'll be in the way, you say.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> If you please, sir, I'll take a chair, and go
to Mr. Sealand's, where the young lady and I will wait
your leisure.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> By no means. The old fellow will be so
vain if he sees&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Ay; but the young lady, sir, will think me
so indifferent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Ay, there you are right; press your readiness
to go to the bride&mdash;he won't let you. [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Bev. Jun.</span></p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Are you sure of that? [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Humph.</span></p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> How he likes being prevented. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> No, no. You are an hour or two too
early. [<i>Looking on his watch.</i></p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> You'll allow me, sir, to think it too late to
visit a beautiful, virtuous young woman, in the pride and
bloom of life, ready to give herself to my arms; and to
place her happiness or misery, for the future, in being
agreeable or displeasing to me, is a&mdash;&mdash;Call a chair.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> No, no, no, dear Jack; this Sealand is a
moody old fellow. There's no dealing with some people
but by managing with indifference. We must leave to
him the conduct of this day. It is the last of his commanding
his daughter.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Sir, he can't take it ill, that I am impatient
to be hers.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Pray let me govern in this matter; you
can't tell how humorsome old fellows are. There's no
offering reason to some of 'em, especially when they are
rich.&mdash;If my son should see him before I've brought old
Sealand into better temper, the match would be impracticable.
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Pray, sir, let me beg you to let Mr. Bevil go.&mdash;See
whether he will or not. [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Sir John</span>]&mdash;[<i>Then to</i>
<span class="smcap">Bev</span>.] Pray, sir, command yourself; since you see my
master is positive, it is better you should not go.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> My father commands me, as to the object of
my affections; but I hope he will not, as to the warmth
and height of them.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> So! I must even leave things as I found
them; and in the meantime, at least, keep old Sealand
out of his sight&mdash;Well, son, I'll go myself and take
orders in your affair. You'll be in the way, I suppose,
if I send to you. I'll leave your old friend with you&mdash;Humphry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
don't let him stir, d'ye hear?&mdash;Your servant,
your servant. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Sir John</span>.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> I have a sad time on't, sir, between you and
my master. I see you are unwilling, and I know his
violent inclinations for the match.&mdash;I must betray
neither, and yet deceive you both, for your common
good. Heaven grant a good end of this matter.&mdash;But
there is a lady, sir, that gives your father much trouble
and sorrow.&mdash;You'll pardon me.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Humphry, I know thou art a friend to
both, and in that confidence I dare tell thee, that lady
is a woman of honour and virtue. You may assure
yourself I never will marry without my father's consent.
But give me leave to say, too, this declaration does not
come up to a promise that I will take whomsoever he
pleases.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Come, sir, I wholly understand you. You
would engage my services to free you from this woman
whom my master intends you, to make way, in time, for
the woman you have really a mind to.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Honest Humphry, you have always been a
useful friend to my father and myself; I beg you continue
your good offices, and don't let us come to the
necessity of a dispute; for, if we should dispute, I must
either part with more than life, or lose the best of fathers.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> My dear master, were I but worthy to know
this secret, that so near concerns you, my life, my all
should be engaged to serve you. This, sir, I dare promise,
that I am sure I will and can be secret: your trust,
at worst, but leaves you where you were; and if I cannot
serve you, I will at once be plain and tell you so.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> That's all I ask. Thou hast made it now
my interest to trust thee. Be patient, then, and hear
the story of my heart.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> I am all attention, sir.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> You may remember, Humphry, that in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
last travels my father grew uneasy at my making so long
a stay at Toulon.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> I remember it; he was apprehensive some
woman had laid hold of you.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> His fears were just; for there I first saw this
lady. She is of English birth: her father's name was
Danvers&mdash;a younger brother of an ancient family, and
originally an eminent merchant of Bristol, who, upon
repeated misfortunes, was reduced to go privately to the
Indies. In this retreat, Providence again grew favourable
to his industry, and, in six years' time, restored him to
his former fortunes. On this he sent directions over that
his wife and little family should follow him to the Indies.
His wife, impatient to obey such welcome orders, would
not wait the leisure of a convoy, but took the first occasion
of a single ship, and, with her husband's sister only,
and this daughter, then scarce seven years old, undertook
the fatal voyage&mdash;for here, poor creature, she lost
her liberty and life. She and her family, with all they
had, were, unfortunately, taken by a privateer from
Toulon. Being thus made a prisoner, though as such
not ill-treated, yet the fright, the shock, and cruel disappointment,
seized with such violence upon her unhealthy
frame, she sickened, pined, and died at sea.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Poor soul! O the helpless infant!</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Her sister yet survived, and had the care of her.
The captain, too, proved to have humanity, and became
a father to her; for having himself married an English
woman, and being childless, he brought home into
Toulon this her little country-woman, presenting her,
with all her dead mother's movables of value, to his
wife, to be educated as his own adopted daughter.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Fortune here seemed again to smile on her.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Only to make her frowns more terrible; for, in
his height of fortune, this captain, too, her benefactor,
unfortunately was killed at sea; and dying intestate, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
estate fell wholly to an advocate, his brother, who,
coming soon to take possession, there found (among his
other riches) this blooming virgin at his mercy.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> He durst not, sure, abuse his power?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> No wonder if his pampered blood was fired at
the sight of her&mdash;in short, he loved; but when all arts
and gentle means had failed to move, he offered, too,
his menaces in vain, denouncing vengeance on her
cruelty, demanding her to account for all her maintenance
from her childhood; seized on her little fortune
as his own inheritance, and was dragging her by violence
to prison, when Providence at the instant interposed,
and sent me, by miracle, to relieve her.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> 'Twas Providence, indeed. But pray, sir,
after all this trouble, how came this lady at last to England?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> The disappointed advocate, finding she had so
unexpected a support, on cooler thoughts, descended to
a composition, which I, without her knowledge, secretly
discharged.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> That generous concealment made the obligation
double.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Having thus obtained her liberty, I prevailed,
not without some difficulty, to see her safe to England;
where, no sooner arrived, but my father, jealous of my
being imprudently engaged, immediately proposed this
other fatal match that hangs upon my quiet.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> I find, sir, you are irrecoverably fixed upon
this lady.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> As my vital life dwells in my heart&mdash;and yet you
see what I do to please my father: walk in this pageantry
of dress, this splendid covering of sorrow&mdash;But, Humphry,
you have your lesson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Now, sir, I have but one material question&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Ask it freely.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Is it, then, your own passion for this secret
lady, or hers for you, that gives you this aversion to the
match your father has proposed you?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> I shall appear, Humphry, more romantic in my
answer than in all the rest of my story; for though I
dote on her to death, and have no little reason to
believe she has the same thoughts for me, yet in all
my acquaintance and utmost privacies with her, I never
once directly told her that I loved.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> How was it possible to avoid it?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> My tender obligations to my father have laid so
inviolable a restraint upon my conduct that, till I have
his consent to speak, I am determined, on that subject,
to be dumb for ever.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Well, sir, to your praise be it spoken, you
are certainly the most unfashionable lover in Great
Britain.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Sir, Mr. Myrtle's at the next door, and, if you
are at leisure, will be glad to wait on you.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Whenever he pleases&mdash;&mdash;hold, Tom! did you
receive no answer to my letter?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Sir, I was desired to call again; for I was told
her mother would not let her be out of her sight; but
about an hour hence, Mrs. Lettice said, I should certainly
have one.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Very well. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Sir, I will take another opportunity. In the
meantime, I only think it proper to tell you that, from a
secret I know, you may appear to your father as forward
as you please, to marry Lucinda without the least hazard
of its coming to a conclusion&mdash;Sir, your most obedient
servant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Honest Humphry, continue but my friend in
this exigence, and you shall always find me yours. [<i>Exit</i>
<span class="smcap">Humph.</span>]&mdash;I long to hear how my letter has succeeded
with Lucinda&mdash;but I think it cannot fail; for, at worst,
were it possible she could take it ill, her resentment of
my indifference may as probably occasion a delay as her
taking it right. Poor Myrtle, what terrors must he be in
all this while? Since he knows she is offered to me, and
refused to him, there is no conversing or taking any
measures with him for his own service.&mdash;But I
ought to bear with my friend, and use him as one in
adversity&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All his disquiets by my own I prove,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The greatest grief's perplexity in love.</span><br />

<h3>ACT THE SECOND.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bevil, Jun.'s</span> <i>Lodgings.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bevil, Jun.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Sir, Mr. Myrtle.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Very well, do you step
again, and wait for an answer to my
letter. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Myrtle</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Well, Charles, why so
much care in thy countenance? Is
there anything in this world deserves it? You, who
used to be so gay, so open, so vacant!</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> I think we have of late changed complexions.
You, who used to be much the graver man, are now all
air in your behaviour.&mdash;But the cause of my concern may,
for aught I know, be the same object that gives you all
this satisfaction. In a word, I am told that you are this
very day&mdash;and your dress confirms me in it&mdash;to be married
to Lucinda.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> You are not misinformed.&mdash;Nay, put not on
the terrors of a rival till you hear me out. I shall disoblige
the best of fathers if I don't seem ready to marry
Lucinda; and you know I have ever told you you might
make use of my secret resolution never to marry her for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
your own service as you please; but I am now driven to
the extremity of immediately refusing or complying unless
you help me to escape the match.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Escape? Sir, neither her merit or her fortune
are below your acceptance&mdash;Escaping do you
call it?</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Dear sir, do you wish I should desire the
match?</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> No; but such is my humorous and sickly state
of mind since it has been able to relish nothing but
Lucinda, that though I must owe my happiness to your
aversion to this marriage, I can't bear to hear her spoken
of with levity or unconcern.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Pardon me, sir, I shall transgress that way
no more. She has understanding, beauty, shape,
complexion, wit&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Nay, dear Bevil, don't speak of her as if you
loved her neither.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Why, then, to give you ease at once, though
I allow Lucinda to have good sense, wit, beauty, and
virtue, I know another in whom these qualities appear to
me more amiable than in her.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> There you spoke like a reasonable and good-natured
friend. When you acknowledge her merit, and
own your prepossession for another, at once you gratify
my fondness and cure my jealousy.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> But all this while you take no notice, you
have no apprehension, of another man that has twice the
fortune of either of us.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Cimberton!<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> hang him, a formal, philosophical,
pedantic coxcomb; for the sot, with all these crude
notions of divers things, under the direction of great
vanity and very little judgment, shows his strongest bias
is avarice; which is so predominant in him that he will
examine the limbs of his mistress with the caution of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
jockey, and pays no more compliment to her personal
charms than if she were a mere breeding animal.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Are you sure that is not affected? I have
known some women sooner set on fire by that sort of
negligence than by&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> No, no; hang him, the rogue has no art; it is
pure, simple insolence and stupidity.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Yet, with all this, I don't take him for a fool.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> I own the man is not a natural; he has a very
quick sense, though very slow understanding. He says,
indeed, many things that want only the circumstances of
time and place to be very just and agreeable.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Well, you may be sure of me if you can disappoint
him; but my intelligence says the mother has
actually sent for the conveyancer to draw articles for his
marriage with Lucinda, though those for mine with her
are, by her father's orders, ready for signing; but it
seems she has not thought fit to consult either him or his
daughter in the matter.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Pshaw! a poor troublesome woman. Neither
Lucinda nor her father will ever be brought to comply
with it. Besides, I am sure Cimberton can make no
settlement upon her without the concurrence of his
great uncle, Sir Geoffry, in the west.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Well, sir, and I can tell you that's the very
point that is now laid before her counsel, to know
whether a firm settlement can be made without his
uncle's actual joining in it. Now, pray consider, sir,
when my affair with Lucinda comes, as it soon must, to
an open rupture, how are you sure that Cimberton's
fortune may not then tempt her father, too, to hear his
proposals?</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> There you are right, indeed; that must be provided
against. Do you know who are her counsel?</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun. Yes,</i> for your service I have found out that,
too. They are Serjeant Bramble and Old Target&mdash;by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
the way, they are neither of them known in the family.
Now, I was thinking why you might not put a couple of
false counsel upon her to delay and confound matters a
little; besides, it may probably let you into the bottom
of her whole design against you.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> As how, pray?</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Why, can't you slip on a black wig and a
gown, and be Old Bramble yourself?</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Ha! I don't dislike it.&mdash;But what shall I do for
a brother in the case?</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> What think you of my fellow, Tom? The
rogue's intelligent, and is a good mimic. All his part
will be but to stutter heartily, for that's old Target's case.
Nay, it would be an immoral thing to mock him were it
not that his impertinence is the occasion of its breaking
out to that degree. The conduct of the scene will chiefly
lie upon you.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> I like it of all things. If you'll send Tom to
my chambers, I will give him full instructions. This will
certainly give me occasion to raise difficulties, to puzzle
or confound her project for a while at least.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> I'll warrant you success.&mdash;So far we are
right, then. And now, Charles, your apprehension of my
marrying her is all you have to get over.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Dear Bevil, though I know you are my friend,
yet when I abstract myself from my own interest in the
thing, I know no objection she can make to you, or you
to her, and therefore hope&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Dear Myrtle, I am as much obliged to you
for the cause of your suspicion, as I am offended at the
effect; but, be assured, I am taking measures for your
certain security, and that all things with regard to me
will end in your entire satisfaction.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Well, I'll promise you to be as easy and as confident
as I can, though I cannot but remember that I
have more than life at stake on your fidelity. [<i>Going.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Then depend upon it, you have no chance
against you.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Nay, no ceremony, you know I must be going.
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Myrt.</span></p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Well, this is another instance of the perplexities
which arise, too, in faithful friendship. We must
often in this life go on in our good offices, even
under the displeasure of those to whom we do them, in
compassion to their weaknesses and mistakes.&mdash;But all
this while poor Indiana is tortured with the doubt of me.
She has no support or comfort but in my fidelity, yet sees
me daily pressed to marriage with another. How painful,
in such a crisis, must be every hour she thinks on me!
I'll let her see at least my conduct to her is not changed.
I'll take this opportunity to visit her; for though the
religious vow I have made to my father restrains me from
ever marrying without his approbation, yet that confines
me not from seeing a virtuous woman that is the pure
delight of my eyes and the guiltless joy of my heart.
But the best condition of human life is but a gentler
misery&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To hope for perfect happiness is vain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And love has ever its allays of pain. [<i>Exit.</i></span><br />

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Isabella</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Indiana</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Yes, I say 'tis artifice, dear child. I say to thee
again and again 'tis all skill and management.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Will you persuade me there can be an ill design
in supporting me in the condition of a woman of quality?
attended, dressed, and lodged like one; in my appearance
abroad and my furniture at home, every way in the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
sumptuous manner, and he that does it has an artifice,
a design in it?</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Yes, yes.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> And all this without so much as explaining to me
that all about me comes from him!</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Ay, ay, the more for that. That keeps the title
to all you have the more in him.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> The more in him! He scorns the thought&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Then he&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Well, be not so eager. If he is an ill man, let
us look into his stratagems. Here is another of them.
[<i>Showing a letter.</i>] Here's two hundred and fifty pounds
in bank notes, with these words: "To pay for the set of
dressing-plate which will be brought home to-morrow."
Why, dear aunt, now here's another piece of skill for
you, which I own I cannot comprehend; and it is with a
bleeding heart I hear you say anything to the disadvantage
of Mr. Bevil. When he is present I look upon him
as one to whom I owe my life and the support of it;
then, again, as the man who loves me with sincerity and
honour. When his eyes are cast another way, and I dare
survey him, my heart is painfully divided between shame
and love. Oh! could I tell you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Ah! you need not; I imagine all this for you.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> This is my state of mind in his presence; and
when he is absent, you are ever dinning my ears with
notions of the arts of men; that his hidden bounty, his
respectful conduct, his careful provision for me, after his
preserving me from utmost misery, are certain signs he
means nothing but to make I know not what of me.</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Oh! You have a sweet opinion of him, truly.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> I have, when I am with him, ten thousand
things, besides my sex's natural decency and shame, to
suppress my heart, that yearns to thank, to praise, to say
it loves him. I say, thus it is with me while I see him;
and in his absence I am entertained with nothing but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
your endeavours to tear this amiable image from my
heart; and in its stead, to place a base dissembler, an
artful invader of my happiness, my innocence, my honour.</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Ah, poor soul! has not his plot taken? don't
you die for him? has not the way he has taken, been the
most proper with you? Oh! oh! He has sense, and
has judged the thing right.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Go on then, since nothing can answer you; say
what you will of him. Heigh! ho!</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Heigh! ho! indeed. It is better to say so, as
you are now, than as many others are. There are, among
the destroyers of women, the gentle, the generous, the
mild, the affable, the humble, who all, soon after their
success in their designs, turn to the contrary of those
characters. I will own to you, Mr. Bevil carries his
hypocrisy the best of any man living, but still he is a
man, and therefore a hypocrite. They have usurped an
exemption from shame for any baseness, any cruelty
towards us. They embrace without love; they make
vows without conscience of obligation; they are partners,
nay, seducers to the crime, wherein they pretend to be
less guilty.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> That's truly observed. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;But what's all
this to Bevil?</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> This it is to Bevil and all mankind. Trust not
those who will think the worse of you for your confidence
in them; serpents who lie in wait for doves. Won't you
be on your guard against those who would betray you?
Won't you doubt those who would contemn you for believing
'em? Take it from me, fair and natural dealing is to
invite injuries; 'tis bleating to escape wolves who would
devour you! Such is the world&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] and such
(since the behaviour of one man to myself) have I
believed all the rest of the sex.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> I will not doubt the truth of Bevil, I will not
doubt it. He has not spoke of it by an organ that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
given to lying. His eyes are all that have ever told me
that he was mine. I know his virtue, I know his filial
piety, and ought to trust his management with a father
to whom he has uncommon obligations. What have I
to be concerned for? my lesson is very short. If he
takes me for ever, my purpose of life is only to please
him. If he leaves me (which Heaven avert) I know
he'll do it nobly, and I shall have nothing to do but to
learn to die, after worse than death has happened to me.</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Ay, do, persist in your credulity! flatter yourself
that a man of his figure and fortune will make himself
the jest of the town, and marry a handsome beggar for
love.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> The town! I must tell you, madam, the fools
that laugh at Mr. Bevil will but make themselves more
ridiculous; his actions are the result of thinking, and he
has sense enough to make even virtue fashionable.</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> O' my conscience he has turned her head.&mdash;Come,
come, if he were the honest fool you take him for,
why has he kept you here these three weeks, without
sending you to Bristol in search of your father, your
family, and your relations?</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> I am convinced he still designs it, and that
nothing keeps him here, but the necessity of coming to a
breach with his father in regard to the match he has
proposed him. Beside, has he not writ to Bristol? and
has not he advice that my father has not been heard of
there almost these twenty years?</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> All sham, mere evasion; he is afraid, if he
should carry you thither, your honest relations may take
you out of his hands, and so blow up all his wicked
hopes at once.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Wicked hopes! did I ever give him any such?</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Has he ever given you any honest ones? Can
you say, in your conscience, he has ever once offered to
marry you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> No! but by his behaviour I am convinced he
will offer it, the moment 'tis in his power, or consistent
with his honour, to make such a promise good to me.</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> His honour!</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> I will rely upon it; therefore desire you will not
make my life uneasy, by these ungrateful jealousies of
one, to whom I am, and wish to be, obliged. For from
his integrity alone, I have resolved to hope for happiness.</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Nay, I have done my duty; if you won't see, at
your peril be it!</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Let it be&mdash;This is his hour of visiting me.</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Oh! to be sure, keep up your form; don't see
him in a bed-chamber&mdash;[<i>Apart.</i>] This is pure prudence,
when she is liable, wherever he meets her, to be conveyed
where'er he pleases.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> All the rest of my life is but waiting till he comes.
I live only when I'm with him. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Well, go thy ways, thou wilful innocent!&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
I once had almost as much love for a man, who poorly
left me to marry an estate; and I am now, against my
will, what they call an old maid&mdash;but I will not let the
peevishness of that condition grow upon me, only keep
up the suspicion of it, to prevent this creature's being
any other than a virgin, except upon proper terms.
[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Indiana</span>, <i>speaking to a Servant.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Desire Mr. Bevil to walk in&mdash;Design! impossible!
A base designing mind could never think of what
he hourly puts in practice. And yet, since the late
rumour of his marriage, he seems more reserved than
formerly&mdash;he sends in too, before he sees me, to know if
I am at leisure&mdash;such new respects may cover coldness in
the heart; it certainly makes me thoughtful&mdash;I'll know
the worst at once; I'll lay such fair occasions in his way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
that it shall be impossible to avoid an explanation, for
these doubts are insupportable!&mdash;But see, he comes, and
clears them all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bevil</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Madam, your most obedient&mdash;I am afraid I
broke in upon your rest last night; 'twas very late before
we parted, but 'twas your own fault. I never saw you in
such agreeable humour.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> I am extremely glad we were both pleased; for I
thought I never saw you better company.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Me, madam! you rally; I said very little.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> But I am afraid you heard me say a great deal;
and, when a woman is in the talking vein, the most
agreeable thing a man can do, you know, is to have
patience to hear her.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Then it's pity, madam, you should ever be silent,
that we might be always agreeable to one another.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> If I had your talent or power, to make my actions
speak for me, I might indeed be silent, and you pretend
to something more than the agreeable.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> If I might be vain of anything in my power,
madam, 'tis that my understanding, from all your sex,
has marked you out as the most deserving object of my
esteem.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Should I think I deserve this, 'twere enough to
make my vanity forfeit the very esteem you offer me.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> How so, madam?</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Because esteem is the result of reason, and to
deserve it from good sense, the height of human glory.
Nay, I had rather a man of honour should pay me that,
than all the homage of a sincere and humble love.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> You certainly distinguish right, madam; love
often kindles from external merit only.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> But esteem rises from a higher source, the merit
of the soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> True&mdash;And great souls only can deserve it.
[<i>Bowing respectfully.</i></p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Now I think they are greater still, that can so
charitably part with it.</p>

<p><i>Bey. Jun.</i> Now, madam, you make me vain, since the
utmost pride and pleasure of my life is, that I esteem
you as I ought.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] As he ought! still more perplexing!
he neither saves nor kills my hope.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> But, madam, we grow grave, methinks. Let's
find some other subject&mdash;Pray how did you like the
opera last night?</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> First give me leave to thank you for my tickets.</p>

<p><i>Bey. Jun.</i> Oh! your servant, madam. But pray tell
me, you now, who are never partial to the fashion, I
fancy must be the properest judge of a mighty dispute
among the ladies, that is, whether <i>Crispo</i> or <i>Griselda</i><a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> is
the more agreeable entertainment.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> With submission now, I cannot be a proper
judge of this question.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> How so, madam?</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Because I find I have a partiality for one of
them.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Pray which is that?</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> I do not know; there's something in that rural
cottage of Griselda, her forlorn condition, her poverty,
her solitude, her resignation, her innocent slumbers, and
that lulling <i>dolce sogno</i> that's sung over her; it had an
effect upon me that&mdash;in short I never was so well deceived,
at any of them.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> Oh! Now then, I can account for the dispute.
Griselda, it seems, is the distress of an injured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
innocent woman, Crispo, that only of a man in the
same condition; therefore the men are mostly concerned
for Crispo, and, by a natural indulgence, both sexes for
Griselda.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> So that judgment, you think, ought to be for
one, though fancy and complaisance have got ground
for the other. Well! I believe you will never give me
leave to dispute with you on any subject; for I own,
Crispo has its charms for me too. Though in the main,
all the pleasure the best opera gives us is but mere
sensation. Methinks it's pity the mind can't have a
little more share in the entertainment. The music's certainly
fine, but, in my thoughts, there's none of your
composers come up to old Shakespeare and Otway.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> How, madam! why if a woman of your sense
were to say this in a drawing-room&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter a</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Serv.</i> Sir, here's Signor Carbonelli<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> says he waits your
commands in the next room.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Apropos! you were saying yesterday, madam,
you had a mind to hear him. Will you give him leave
to entertain you now?</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> By all means; desire the gentleman to walk in.
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> I fancy you will find something in this hand that
is uncommon.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> You are always finding ways, Mr. Bevil, to make
life seem less tedious to me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Music Master</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the gentleman pleases.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>After a Sonata is played,</i> <span class="smcap">Bevil</span> <i>waits on the
Master to the door, etc.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Bev.</i> You smile, madam, to see me so complaisant to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
one whom I pay for his visit. Now, I own, I think it is
not enough barely to pay those whose talents are superior
to our own (I mean such talents as would become our
condition, if we had them). Methinks we ought to do
something more than barely gratify them for what they
do at our command, only because their fortune is below
us.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> You say I smile. I assure you it was a smile of
approbation; for, indeed, I cannot but think it the distinguishing
part of a gentleman to make his superiority
of fortune as easy to his inferiors as he can.&mdash;Now once
more to try him. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;I was saying just now, I
believed you would never let me dispute with you, and I
daresay it will always be so. However, I must have
your opinion upon a subject which created a debate
between my aunt and me, just before you came hither;
she would needs have it that no man ever does any
extraordinary kindness or service for a woman, but for
his own sake.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Well, madam! Indeed I can't but be of her
mind.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> What, though he should maintain and support
her, without demanding anything of her, on her part?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Why, madam, is making an expense in the service
of a valuable woman (for such I must suppose her),
though she should never do him any favour, nay, though
she should never know who did her such service, such a
mighty heroic business?</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Certainly! I should think he must be a man of
an uncommon mould.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Dear madam, why so? 'tis but, at best, a better
taste in expense. To bestow upon one, whom he may
think one of the ornaments of the whole creation, to be
conscious, that from his superfluity, an innocent, a
virtuous spirit is supported above the temptations and
sorrows of life! That he sees satisfaction, health, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
gladness in her countenance, while he enjoys the happiness
of seeing her (as that I will suppose too, or he must
be too abstracted, too insensible), I say, if he is allowed
to delight in that prospect; alas, what mighty matter is
there in all this?</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> No mighty matter in so disinterested a friendship!</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Disinterested! I can't think him so; your hero,
madam, is no more than what every gentleman ought to
be, and I believe very many are. He is only one who
takes more delight in reflections than in sensations. He is
more pleased with thinking than eating; that's the utmost
you can say of him. Why, madam, a greater expense
than all this, men lay out upon an unnecessary stable of
horses.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Can you be sincere in what you say?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> You may depend upon it, if you know any such
man, he does not love dogs inordinately.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> No, that he does not.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Nor cards, nor dice.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Nor bottle companions.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Nor loose women.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> No, I'm sure he does not.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Take my word then, if your admired hero is not
liable to any of these kind of demands, there's no such
pre-eminence in this as you imagine. Nay, this way of
expense you speak of is what exalts and raises him that
has a taste for it; and, at the same time, his delight is
incapable of satiety, disgust, or penitence.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> But still I insist his having no private interest in
the action, makes it prodigious, almost incredible.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Dear madam, I never knew you more mistaken.
Why, who can be more a usurer than he who lays out
his money in such valuable purchases? If pleasure be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
worth purchasing, how great a pleasure is it to him, who
has a true taste of life, to ease an aching heart; to see the
human countenance lighted up into smiles of joy, on the
receipt of a bit of ore which is superfluous and otherwise
useless in a man's own pocket? What could a man do
better with his cash? This is the effect of a human
disposition, where there is only a general tie of nature
and common necessity. What then must it be when we
serve an object of merit, of admiration!</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Well! the more you argue against it the more I
shall admire the generosity.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Nay, nay&mdash;Then, madam, 'tis time to fly, after a
declaration that my opinion strengthens my adversary's
argument. I had best hasten to my appointment with
Mr. Myrtle, and begone while we are friends, and before
things are brought to an extremity. [<i>Exit, carelessly.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Isabella</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Well, madam, what think you of him now, pray?</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> I protest, I begin to fear he is wholly disinterested
in what he does for me. On my heart, he has no
other view but the mere pleasure of doing it, and has
neither good or bad designs upon me.</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Ah! dear niece! don't be in fear of both! I'll
warrant you, you will know time enough that he is not
indifferent.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> You please me when you tell me so; for, if he
has any wishes towards me, I know he will not pursue
them but with honour.</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> I wish I were as confident of one as t'other. I
saw the respectful downcast of his eye, when you caught
him gazing at you during the music. He, I warrant,
was surprised, as if he had been taken stealing your
watch. Oh! the undissembled guilty look!</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> But did you observe any such thing, really? I
thought he looked most charmingly graceful! How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
engaging is modesty in a man, when one knows there is
a great mind within. So tender a confusion! and yet, in
other respects, so much himself, so collected, so dauntless,
so determined!</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Ah! niece! there is a sort of bashfulness which
is the best engine to carry on a shameless purpose. Some
men's modesty serves their wickedness, as hypocrisy
gains the respect due to piety. But I will own to you,
there is one hopeful symptom, if there could be such a
thing as a disinterested lover. But it's all a perplexity&mdash;till&mdash;till&mdash;till&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Till what?</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Till I know whether Mr. Myrtle and Mr. Bevil
are really friends or foes.&mdash;And that I will be convinced
of before I sleep; for you shall not be deceived.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> I'm sure I never shall, if your fears can guard me.
In the meantime I'll wrap myself up in the integrity of
my own heart, nor dare to doubt of his.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As conscious honour all his actions steers,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So conscious innocence dispels my fears. [<i>Exeunt.</i></span><br />

<h3>ACT THE THIRD.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></h3>


<h4>SCENE.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sealand's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, <i>meeting</i> <span class="smcap">Phillis</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Well, Phillis! What, with a face
as if you had never seen me before!&mdash;What
a work have I to do now?
She has seen some new visitant at
their house whose airs she has caught,
and is resolved to practise them
upon me. Numberless are the
changes she'll dance through before she'll answer this
plain question: videlicet, have you delivered my master's
letter to your lady? Nay, I know her too well to ask
an account of it in an ordinary way; I'll be in my airs as
well as she. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Well, madam, as unhappy as you
are at present pleased to make me, I would not, in the
general, be any other than what I am. I would not be
a bit wiser, a bit richer, a bit taller, a bit shorter than I
am at this instant. [<i>Looking steadfastly at her.</i></p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Did ever anybody doubt, Master Thomas, but
that you were extremely satisfied with your sweet self?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I am, indeed. The thing I have least reason to
be satisfied with is my fortune, and I am glad of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
poverty. Perhaps if I were rich I should overlook the
finest woman in the world, that wants nothing but riches
to be thought so.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> How prettily was that said! But I'll have a
great deal more before I'll say one word. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I should, perhaps, have been stupidly above her
had I not been her equal; and by not being her equal,
never had opportunity of being her slave. I am my
master's servant for hire&mdash;I am my mistress's from choice,
would she but approve my passion.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> I think it's the first time I ever heard you speak
of it with any sense of the anguish, if you really do suffer
any.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Ah, Phillis! can you doubt, after what you have
seen?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> I know not what I have seen, nor what I have
heard; but since I am at leisure, you may tell me when
you fell in love with me; how you fell in love with me;
and what you have suffered or are ready to suffer for
me.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Oh, the unmerciful jade! when I am in haste
about my master's letter. But I must go through it.
[<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Ah!<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> too well I remember when, and how, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
on what occasion I was first surprised. It was on the
1st of April, 1715, I came into Mr. Sealand's service; I
was then a hobbledehoy, and you a pretty little tight
girl, a favourite handmaid of the housekeeper. At that
time we neither of us knew what was in us. I remember
I was ordered to get out of the window, one pair of
stairs, to rub the sashes clean; the person employed on
the inner side was your charming self, whom I had never
seen before.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> I think I remember the silly accident. What
made ye, you oaf, ready to fall down into the street?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> You know not, I warrant you&mdash;you could not
guess what surprised me. You took no delight when
you immediately grew wanton in your conquest, and put
your lips close, and breathed upon the glass, and when
my lips approached, a dirty cloth you rubbed against my
face, and hid your beauteous form! When I again drew
near, you spit, and rubbed, and smiled at my undoing.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> What silly thoughts you men have!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> We were Pyramus and Thisbe&mdash;but ten times
harder was my fate. Pyramus could peep only through
a wall; I saw her, saw my Thisbe in all her beauty, but
as much kept from her as if a hundred walls between&mdash;for
there was more: there was her will against me.
Would she but yet relent! O Phillis! Phillis! shorten
my torment, and declare you pity me.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> I believe it's very sufferable; the pain is not so
exquisite but that you may bear it a little longer.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Oh! my charming Phillis, if all depended on
my fair one's will, I could with glory suffer&mdash;but, dearest
creature, consider our miserable state.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> How! Miserable!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> We are miserable to be in love, and under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
command of others than those we love; with that generous
passion in the heart, to be sent to and fro on
errands, called, checked, and rated for the meanest
trifles. Oh, Phillis! you don't know how many china
cups and glasses my passion for you has made me break.
You have broke my fortune as well as my heart.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Well, Mr. Thomas, I cannot but own to you
that I believe your master writes and you speak the best
of any men in the world. Never was woman so well
pleased with a letter as my young lady was with his; and
this is an answer to it. [<i>Gives him a letter.</i></p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> This was well done, my dearest; consider, we
must strike out some pretty livelihood for ourselves by
closing their affairs. It will be nothing for them to give
us a little being of our own, some small tenement, out of
their large possessions. Whatever they give us, it will be
more than what they keep for themselves. One acre
with Phillis would be worth a whole county without her.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> O, could I but believe you!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> If not the utterance, believe the touch of my
lips. [<i>Kisses her.</i></p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> There's no contradicting you. How closely you
argue, Tom!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> And will closer, in due time. But I must hasten
with this letter, to hasten towards the possession of you.
Then, Phillis, consider how I must be revenged, look to
it, of all your skittishness, shy looks, and at best but coy
compliances.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Oh, Tom, you grow wanton, and sensual, as my
lady calls it; I must not endure it. Oh! foh! you are
a man&mdash;an odious, filthy, male creature&mdash;you should behave,
if you had a right sense or were a man of sense,
like Mr. Cimberton, with distance and indifference; or,
let me see, some other becoming hard word, with seeming
in-in-inadvertency, and not rush on one as if you were
seizing a prey.&mdash;But hush! the ladies are coming.&mdash;Good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
Tom, don't kiss me above once, and be gone. Lard, we
have been fooling and toying, and not considered the
main business of our masters and mistresses.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Why, their business is to be fooling and toying
as soon as the parchments are ready.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Well remembered, parchments; my lady, to my
knowledge, is preparing writings between her coxcomb
cousin, Cimberton, and my mistress, though my master
has an eye to the parchments already prepared between
your master, Mr. Bevil, and my mistress; and, I believe,
my mistress herself has signed and sealed, in her
heart, to Mr. Myrtle.&mdash;Did I not bid you kiss me but
once, and be gone? But I know you won't be satisfied.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> No, you smooth creature, how should I?
[<i>Kissing her hand.</i></p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Well, since you are so humble, or so cool, as to
ravish my hand only, I'll take my leave of you like a
great lady, and you a man of quality.
[<i>They salute formally.</i></p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Pox of all this state.
[<i>Offers to kiss her more closely.</i></p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> No, prithee, Tom, mind your business. We
must follow that interest which will take, but endeavour
at that which will be most for us, and we like most. Oh,
here is my young mistress! [<span class="smcap">Tom</span> <i>taps her neck behind,
and kisses his fingers.</i>] Go, ye liquorish fool. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lucinda</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Who was that you were hurrying away?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> One that I had no mind to part with.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Why did you turn him away then?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> For your ladyship's service&mdash;to carry your ladyship's
letter to his master. I could hardly get the rogue
away.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Why, has he so little love for his master?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> No; but he hath so much love for his mistress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> But I thought I heard him kiss you. Why did
you suffer that?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Why, madam, we vulgar take it to be a sign of
love&mdash;We servants, we poor people, that have nothing
but our persons to bestow or treat for, are forced to deal
and bargain by way of sample, and therefore as we have
no parchments or wax necessary in our agreements, we
squeeze with our hands and seal with our lips, to ratify
vows and promises.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> But can't you trust one another without such
earnest down?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> We don't think it safe, any more than you gentry,
to come together without deeds executed.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Thou art a pert merry hussy.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> I wish, madam, your lover and you were as
happy as Tom and your servant are.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> You grow impertinent.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> I have done, madam; and I won't ask you what
you intend to do with Mr. Myrtle, what your father will
do with Mr. Bevil, nor what you all, especially my lady,
mean by admitting Mr. Cimberton as particularly here
as if he were married to you already; nay, you are married
actually as far as people of quality are.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> How is that?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> You have different beds in the same house.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Pshaw! I have a very great value for Mr. Bevil,
but have absolutely put an end to his pretensions in the
letter I gave you for him. But my father, in his heart,
still has a mind to him, were it not for this woman they
talk of; and I am apt to imagine he is married to her,
or never designs to marry at all.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Then Mr. Myrtle&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> He had my parents' leave to apply to me, and by
that he has won me and my affections; who is to have
this body of mine without them, it seems, is nothing to
me. My mother says 'tis indecent for me to let my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
thoughts stray about the person of my husband; nay,
she says a maid, rigidly virtuous, though she may have
been where her lover was a thousand times, should not
have made observations enough to know him from
another man when she sees him in a third place.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> That is more than the severity of a nun, for not
to see when one may is hardly possible; not to see when
one can't is very easy. At this rate, madam, there are a
great many whom you have not seen who&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Mamma says the first time you see your husband
should be at that instant he is made so. When your
father, with the help of the minister, gives you to him,
then you are to see him; then you are to observe and
take notice of him; because then you are to obey him.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> But does not my lady remember you are to love
as well as obey?</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> To love is a passion, it is a desire, and we must
have no desires.&mdash;Oh, I cannot endure the reflection!
With what insensibility on my part, with what more than
patience have I been exposed and offered to some awkward
booby or other in every county of Great Britain!</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Indeed, madam, I wonder I never heard you
speak of it before with this indignation.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Every corner of the land has presented me with
a wealthy coxcomb. As fast as one treaty has gone off,
another has come on, till my name and person have been
the tittle-tattle of the whole town. What is this world
come to?&mdash;no shame left&mdash;to be bartered for like the
beasts of the field, and that in such an instance as coming
together to an entire familiarity and union of soul
and body. Oh! and this without being so much as well-wishers
to each other, but for increase of fortune.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> But, madam, all these vexations will end very
soon in one for all. Mr. Cimberton is your mother's
kinsman, and three hundred years an older gentleman
than any lover you ever had; for which reason, with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
of his prodigious large estate, she is resolved on him, and
has sent to consult the lawyers accordingly; nay, has
(whether you know it or no) been in treaty with Sir
Geoffry, who, to join in the settlement, has accepted of a
sum to do it, and is every moment expected in town for
that purpose.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> How do you get all this intelligence?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> By an art I have, I thank my stars, beyond all
the waiting-maids in Great Britain&mdash;the art of listening,
madam, for your ladyship's service.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> I shall soon know as much as you do; leave me,
leave me, Phillis, begone. Here, here! I'll turn you
out. My mother says I must not converse with my servants,
though I must converse with no one else. [<i>Exit</i>
<span class="smcap">Phil.</span>]&mdash;How unhappy are we who are born to great
fortunes! No one looks at us with indifference, or acts
towards us on the foot of plain dealing; yet, by all I
have been heretofore offered to or treated for I have been
used with the most agreeable of all abuses&mdash;flattery. But
now, by this phlegmatic fool I'm used as nothing, or a
mere thing. He, forsooth, is too wise, too learned to
have any regard for desires, and I know not what the
learned oaf calls sentiments of love and passion&mdash;Here
he comes with my mother&mdash;It's much if he looks at me,
or if he does, takes no more notice of me than of any
other movable in the room.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Sealand</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Cimberton</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> How do I admire this noble, this learned
taste of yours, and the worthy regard you have to our
own ancient and honourable house in consulting a means
to keep the blood as pure and as regularly descended as
may be.</p>

<p><i>Cim.</i> Why, really, madam, the young women of this
age are treated with discourses of such a tendency, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
their imaginations so bewildered in flesh and blood, that
a man of reason can't talk to be understood. They
have no ideas of happiness, but what are more gross than
the gratification of hunger and thirst.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> With how much reflection he is a coxcomb!
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Cim.</i> And in truth, madam, I have considered it as a
most brutal custom that persons of the first character in
the world should go as ordinarily, and with as little shame,
to bed as to dinner with one another. They proceed to
the propagation of the species as openly as to the preservation
of the individual.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> She that willingly goes to bed to thee must have
no shame, I'm sure. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> Oh, cousin Cimberton! cousin Cimberton!
how abstracted, how refined is your sense of things! But,
indeed, it is too true there is nothing so ordinary as to
say, in the best governed families, my master and lady
have gone to bed; one does not know but it might
have been said of one's self. [<i>Hiding her face with her fan.</i></p>

<p><i>Cim.</i> Lycurgus, madam, instituted otherwise; among
the Lacedæmonians the whole female world was pregnant,
but none but the mothers themselves knew by whom;
their meetings were secret, and the amorous congress
always by stealth; and no such professed doings between
the sexes as are tolerated among us under the audacious
word, marriage.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> Oh, had I lived in those days and been a
matron of Sparta, one might with less indecency have
had ten children, according to that modest institution,
than one, under the confusion of our modern, barefaced
manner.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> And yet, poor woman, she has gone through the
whole ceremony, and here I stand a melancholy proof of
it. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> We will talk then of business. That girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
walking about the room there is to be your wife. She
has, I confess, no ideas, no sentiments, that speak her
born of a thinking mother.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> I have observed her; her lively look, free air,
and disengaged countenance speak her very&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Very what?</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> If you please, madam&mdash;to set her a little that
way.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> Lucinda, say nothing to him, you are not
a match for him; when you are married, you may speak
to such a husband when you're spoken to. But I am
disposing of you above yourself every way.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> Madam, you cannot but observe the inconveniences
I expose myself to, in hopes that your ladyship
will be the consort of my better part. As for the
young woman, she is rather an impediment than a help
to a man of letters and speculation. Madam, there is no
reflection, no philosophy, can at all times subdue the
sensitive life, but the animal shall sometimes carry away
the man. Ha! ay, the vermilion of her lips.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Pray, don't talk of me thus.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> The pretty enough&mdash;pant of her bosom.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Sir! madam, don't you hear him?</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> Her forward chest.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Intolerable!</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> High health.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> The grave, easy impudence of him!</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> Proud heart.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Stupid coxcomb!</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> I say, madam, her impatience, while we are
looking at her, throws out all attractions&mdash;her arms&mdash;her
neck&mdash;what a spring in her step!</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Don't you run me over thus, you strange unaccountable!</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> What an elasticity in her veins and arteries!</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> I have no veins, no arteries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> Oh, child! hear him, he talks finely; he's a
scholar, he knows what you have.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> The speaking invitation of her shape, the
gathering of herself up, and the indignation you see in
the pretty little thing&mdash;Now, I am considering her, on
this occasion, but as one that is to be pregnant.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> The familiar, learned, unseasonable puppy!
[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> And pregnant undoubtedly she will be yearly.
I fear I shan't, for many years, have discretion enough to
give her one fallow season.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Monster! there's no bearing it. The hideous
sot! there's no enduring it, to be thus surveyed like a
steed at sale.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> At sale! She's very illiterate&mdash;But she's very
well limbed too; turn her in; I see what she is.
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Lucinda</span>, <i>in a rage.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> Go, you creature, I am ashamed of you.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> No harm done&mdash;you know, madam, the better
sort of people, as I observed to you, treat by their lawyers
of weddings [<i>Adjusting himself at the glass.</i>]&mdash;and the
woman in the bargain, like the mansion house in the
sale of the estate, is thrown in, and what that is, whether
good or bad, is not at all considered.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> I grant it; and therefore make no demand
for her youth and beauty, and every other accomplishment,
as the common world think 'em, because she is
not polite.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> Madam, I know your exalted understanding,
abstracted, as it is, from vulgar prejudices, will not be
offended, when I declare to you, I marry to have an heir
to my estate, and not to beget a colony, or a plantation.
This young woman's beauty and constitution will demand
provision for a tenth child at least.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> With all that wit and learning, how considerate!
What an economist! [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Sir, I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
make her any other than she is; or say she is much
better than the other young women of this age, or fit for
much besides being a mother; but I have given directions
for the marriage settlements, and Sir Geoffry Cimberton's
counsel is to meet ours here, at this hour, concerning
this joining in the deed, which, when executed,
makes you capable of settling what is due to Lucinda's
fortune. Herself, as I told you, I say nothing of.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> No, no, no, indeed, madam, it is not usual; and
I must depend upon my own reflection and philosophy
not to overstock my family.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> I cannot help her, cousin Cimberton; but
she is, for aught I see, as well as the daughter of anybody
else.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> That is very true, madam.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter a</i> Servant, <i>who whispers</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Sealand</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> The lawyers are come, and now we are to
hear what they have resolved as to the point whether it's
necessary that Sir Geoffry should join in the settlement,
as being what they call in the remainder. But, good
cousin, you must have patience with 'em. These lawyers,
I am told, are of a different kind; one is what they call a
chamber counsel, the other a pleader. The conveyancer
is slow, from an imperfection in his speech, and therefore
shunned the bar, but extremely passionate and impatient
of contradiction. The other is as warm as he; but has
a tongue so voluble, and a head so conceited, he will
suffer nobody to speak but himself.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> You mean old Serjeant Target and Counsellor
Bramble? I have heard of 'em.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> The same. Show in the gentlemen.
[<i>Exit</i> Servant.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Re-enter</i> Servant, <i>introducing</i> <span class="smcap">Myrtle</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span> <i>disguised
as</i> <span class="smcap">Bramble</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Target</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> Gentlemen, this is the party concerned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
Mr. Cimberton; and I hope you have considered of the
matter.</p>

<p><i>Tar.</i> Yes, madam, we have agreed that it must be by
indent&mdash;&mdash;dent&mdash;&mdash;dent&mdash;&mdash;dent&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bram.</i> Yes, madam, Mr. Serjeant and myself have
agreed, as he is pleased to inform you, that it must be
an indenture tripartite,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and tripartite let it be, for Sir
Geoffry must needs be a party; old Cimberton, in the
year 1619, says, in that ancient roll in Mr. Serjeant's
hands, as recourse thereto being had, will more at large
appear&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tar.</i> Yes, and by the deeds in your hands, it appears
that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bram.</i> Mr. Serjeant, I beg of you to make no inferences
upon what is in our custody; but speak to the
titles in your own deeds. I shall not show that deed till
my client is in town.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> You know best your own methods.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> The single question is, whether the entail
is such that my cousin, Sir Geoffry, is necessary in this
affair?</p>

<p><i>Bram.</i> Yes, as to the lordship of Tretriplet, but not as
to the messuage of Grimgribber.</p>

<p><i>Tar.</i> I say that Gr&mdash;gr&mdash;that Gr&mdash;gr&mdash;Grimgribber,
Grimgribber is in us; that is to say the remainder
thereof, as well as that of Tr&mdash;tr&mdash;Triplet.</p>

<p><i>Bram.</i> You go upon the deed of Sir Ralph, made in
the middle of the last century, precedent to that in which
old Cimberton made over the remainder, and made it
pass to the heirs general, by which your client comes in;
and I question whether the remainder even of Tretriplet
is in him&mdash;But we are willing to waive that, and give
him a valuable consideration. But we shall not purchase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
what is in us for ever, as Grimgribber is, at the rate, as
we guard against the contingent of Mr. Cimberton having
no son&mdash;Then we know Sir Geoffry is the first of the
collateral male line in this family&mdash;yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tar.</i> Sir, Gr&mdash;&mdash;gr&mdash;&mdash;ber is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bram.</i> I apprehend you very well, and your argument
might be of force, and we would be inclined to hear that
in all its parts&mdash;But, sir, I see very plainly what you are
going into. I tell you, it is as probable a contingent
that Sir Geoffry may die before Mr. Cimberton, as that
he may outlive him.</p>

<p><i>Tar.</i> Sir, we are not ripe for that yet, but I must
say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bram.</i> Sir, I allow you the whole extent of that argument;
but that will go no farther than as to the claimants
under old Cimberton. I am of opinion that, according
to the instruction of Sir Ralph, he could not dock the
entail, and then create a new estate for the heirs general.</p>

<p><i>Tar.</i> Sir, I have not patience to be told that, when
Gr&mdash;&mdash;gr&mdash;&mdash;ber&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bram.</i> I will allow it you, Mr. Serjeant; but there
must be the word heirs for ever, to make such an estate
as you pretend.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> I must be impartial, though you are counsel for
my side of the question. Were it not that you are so
good as to allow him what he has not said, I should
think it very hard you should answer him without hearing
him&mdash;But, gentlemen, I believe you have both considered
this matter, and are firm in your different opinions.
'Twere better, therefore, you proceeded according to the
particular sense of each of you, and gave your thoughts
distinctly in writing. And do you see, sirs, pray let me
have a copy of what you say in English.</p>

<p><i>Bram.</i> Why, what is all we have been saying? In
English! Oh! but I forget myself, you're a wit. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
however, to please you, sir, you shall have it, in as plain
terms as the law will admit of.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> But I would have it, sir, without delay.</p>

<p><i>Bram.</i> That, sir, the law will not admit of. The
Courts are sitting at Westminster, and I am this moment
obliged to be at every one of them, and 'twould be wrong
if I should not be in the hall to attend one of 'em at
least; the rest would take it ill else. Therefore, I must
leave what I have said to Mr. Serjeant's consideration,
and I will digest his arguments on my part, and you
shall hear from me again, sir. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Bramble</span>.</p>

<p><i>Tar.</i> Agreed, agreed.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> Mr. Bramble is very quick; he parted a little
abruptly.</p>

<p><i>Tar.</i> He could not bear my argument; I pinched
him to the quick about that Gr&mdash;&mdash;gr&mdash;&mdash;ber.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> I saw that, for he durst not so much as
hear you. I shall send to you, Mr. Serjeant, as soon as
Sir Geoffry comes to town, and then I hope all may be
adjusted.</p>

<p><i>Tar.</i> I shall be at my chambers, at my usual hours.
[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> Madam, if you please, I'll now attend you to
the tea table, where I shall hear from your ladyship
reason and good sense, after all this law and gibberish.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> 'Tis a wonderful thing, sir, that men of professions
do not study to talk the substance of what they
have to say in the language of the rest of the world.
Sure, they'd find their account in it.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> They might, perhaps, madam, with people of
your good sense; but with the generality 'twould never
do. The vulgar would have no respect for truth and
knowledge, if they were exposed to naked view.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Truth is too simple, of all art bereaved:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Since the world will&mdash;why let it be deceived.</span><br />

<h3>ACT THE FOURTH.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bevil, Jun.'s</span> <i>Lodgings.</i><a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Bevil, Jun.</span>, <i>with a letter in his hand; followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Upon my life, sir, I know nothing
of the matter. I never opened my
lips to Mr. Myrtle about anything of
your honour's letter to Madam Lucinda.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> What's the fool in such a fright
for? I don't suppose you did. What
I would know is, whether Mr. Myrtle
shows any suspicion, or asked you any questions, to lead
you to say casually that you had carried any such letter
for me this morning.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Why, sir, if he did ask me any questions, how
could I help it?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> I don't say you could, oaf! I am not questioning
you, but him. What did he say to you?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Why, sir, when I came to his chambers, to be
dressed for the lawyer's part your honour was pleased to
put me upon, he asked me if I had been at Mr. Sealand's
this morning? So I told him, sir, I often went
thither&mdash;because, sir, if I had not said that he might
have thought there was something more in my going now
than at another time.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Very well!&mdash;The fellow's caution, I find, has
given him this jealousy. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Did he ask you no
other questions?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Yes, sir; now I remember, as we came away in
the hackney coach from Mr. Sealand's, Tom, says he, as
I came in to your master this morning, he bade you go for
an answer to a letter he had sent. Pray did you bring
him any? says he. Ah! says I, sir, your honour is
pleased to joke with me; you have a mind to know
whether I can keep a secret or no?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> And so, by showing him you could, you told him
you had one?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Sir&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Confused.</i></p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> What mean actions does jealousy make a man
stoop to! How poorly has he used art with a servant to
make him betray his master!&mdash;Well! and when did he
give you this letter for me?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Sir, he writ it before he pulled off his lawyer's
gown, at his own chambers.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Very well; and what did he say when you
brought him my answer to it?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> He looked a little out of humour, sir, and said
it was very well.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> I knew he would be grave upon't; wait without.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Hum! 'gad, I don't like this; I am afraid we
are all in the wrong box here. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> I put on a serenity while my fellow was present;
but I have never been more thoroughly disturbed. This
hot man! to write me a challenge, on supposed artificial
dealing, when I professed myself his friend! I can live
contented without glory; but I cannot suffer shame.
What's to be done? But first let me consider Lucinda's
letter again. [<i>Reads.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"I hope it is consistent with the laws a woman
ought to impose upon herself, to acknowledge that your
manner of declining a treaty of marriage in our family,
and desiring the refusal may come from me, has something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
more engaging in it than the courtship of him who,
I fear, will fall to my lot, except your friend exerts himself
for our common safety and happiness. I have
reasons for desiring Mr. Myrtle may not know of this
letter till hereafter, and am your most obliged humble
servant,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Lucinda Sealand</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, but the postscript&mdash;[<i>Reads.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I won't, upon second thoughts, hide anything from
you. But my reason for concealing this is, that Mr.
Myrtle has a jealousy in his temper which gives me some
terrors; but my esteem for him inclines me to hope that
only an ill effect which sometimes accompanies a tender
love, and what may be cured by a careful and unblameable
conduct."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus has this lady made me her friend and confident,
and put herself, in a kind, under my protection. I cannot
tell him immediately the purport of her letter, except
I could cure him of the violent and untractable passion
of jealousy, and so serve him, and her, by disobeying her,
in the article of secrecy, more than I should by complying
with her directions.&mdash;But then this duelling, which
custom has imposed upon every man who would live with
reputation and honour in the world&mdash;how must I preserve
myself from imputations there? He'll, forsooth,
call it or think it fear, if I explain without fighting.&mdash;But
his letter&mdash;I'll read it again&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"You have used me basely in corresponding and
carrying on a treaty where you told me you were
indifferent. I have changed my sword since I saw you;
which advertisement I thought proper to send you against
the next meeting between you and the injured</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Mr. Myrtle, sir. Would your honour please to
see him?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Why, you stupid creature! Let Mr. Myrtle wait
at my lodgings! Show him up. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>.] Well!
I am resolved upon my carriage to him. He is in love,
and in every circumstance of life a little distrustful, which
I must allow for&mdash;but here he is.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, <i>introducing</i> <span class="smcap">Myrtle</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sir, I am extremely obliged to you for this honour.&mdash;[<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Tom</span>.] But, sir, you, with your very discerning face,
leave the room. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>.]&mdash;Well, Mr. Myrtle, your
commands with me?</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> The time, the place, our long acquaintance,
and many other circumstances which affect me on this
occasion, oblige me, without farther ceremony or conference,
to desire you would not only, as you already have,
acknowledge the receipt of my letter, but also comply
with the request in it. I must have farther notice taken
of my message than these half lines&mdash;"I have yours,"
"I shall be at home."</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Sir, I own I have received a letter from you in
a very unusual style; but as I design everything in this
matter shall be your own action, your own seeking, I
shall understand nothing but what you are pleased to
confirm face to face, and I have already forgot the
contents of your epistle.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> This cool manner is very agreeable to the abuse
you have already made of my simplicity and frankness;
and I see your moderation tends to your own advantage
and not mine&mdash;to your own safety, not consideration of
your friend.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> My own safety, Mr. Myrtle?</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Your own safety, Mr. Bevil.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Look you, Mr. Myrtle, there's no disguising that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
I understand what you would be at; but, sir, you know
I have often dared to disapprove of the decisions a
tyrant custom has introduced, to the breach of all laws,
both divine and human.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Mr. Bevil, Mr. Bevil, it would be a good first
principle, in those who have so tender a conscience that
way, to have as much abhorrence of doing injuries,
as&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> As what?</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> As fear of answering for 'em.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> As fear of answering for 'em! But that apprehension
is just or blameable according to the object of
that fear. I have often told you, in confidence of heart,
I abhorred the daring to offend the Author of life, and
rushing into his presence&mdash;I say, by the very same act,
to commit the crime against Him, and immediately to
urge on to His tribunal.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Mr. Bevil, I must tell you, this coolness, this
gravity, this show of conscience, shall never cheat me of
my mistress. You have, indeed, the best excuse for
life, the hopes of possessing Lucinda. But consider, sir,
I have as much reason to be weary of it, if I am to lose
her; and my first attempt to recover her shall be to let
her see the dauntless man who is to be her guardian and
protector.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Sir, show me but the least glimpse of argument,
that I am authorised, by my own hand, to vindicate any
lawless insult of this nature, and I will show thee&mdash;to
chastise thee hardly deserves the name of courage&mdash;slight,
inconsiderate man!&mdash;There is, Mr. Myrtle, no
such terror in quick anger; and you shall, you know not
why, be cool, as you have, you know not why, been
warm.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Is the woman one loves so little an occasion of
anger? You perhaps, who know not what it is to love,
who have your ready, your commodious, your foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
trinket, for your loose hours; and from your fortune,
your specious outward carriage, and other lucky circumstances,
as easy a way to the possession of a woman of
honour; you know nothing of what it is to be alarmed,
to be distracted with anxiety and terror of losing more
than life. Your marriage, happy man, goes on like
common business, and in the interim you have your
rambling captive, your Indian princess, for your soft
moments of dalliance, your convenient, your ready
Indiana.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> You have touched me beyond the patience of a
man; and I'm excusable, in the guard of innocence (or
from the infirmity of human nature, which can bear no
more), to accept your invitation, and observe your letter&mdash;Sir,
I'll attend you.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Did you call, sir? I thought you did; I heard
you speak aloud.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Yes; go call a coach.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Sir&mdash;master&mdash;Mr. Myrtle&mdash;friends&mdash;gentlemen&mdash;what
d'ye mean? I am but a servant, or&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Call a coach. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>.]&mdash;[<i>A long pause,
walking sullenly by each other.</i>]&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] Shall I (though
provoked to the uttermost) recover myself at the entrance
of a third person, and that my servant too, and
not have respect enough to all I have ever been receiving
from infancy, the obligation to the best of fathers, to
an unhappy virgin too, whose life depends on mine?
[<i>Shutting the door.</i>]&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Myrtle</span>.] I have, thank
Heaven, had time to recollect myself, and shall not, for
fear of what such a rash man as you think of me, keep
longer unexplained the false appearances under which
your infirmity of temper makes you suffer; when perhaps
too much regard to a false point of honour makes
me prolong that suffering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> I am sure Mr. Bevil cannot doubt but I had
rather have satisfaction from his innocence than his
sword.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Why, then, would you ask it first that way?</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Consider, you kept your temper yourself no
longer than till I spoke to the disadvantage of her you
loved.</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> True; but let me tell you, I have saved you
from the most exquisite distress, even though you had
succeeded in the dispute. I know you so well, that I
am sure to have found this letter about a man you had
killed would have been worse than death to yourself&mdash;Read
it.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] When he is thoroughly mortified, and
shame has got the better of jealousy, when he has seen
himself throughly, he will deserve to be assisted towards
obtaining Lucinda.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> With what a superiority has he turned the
injury on me, as the aggressor? I begin to fear I have
been too far transported&mdash;A treaty in our family! is not
that saying too much? I shall relapse.&mdash;But I find (on
the postscript) something like jealousy. With what face
can I see my benefactor, my advocate, whom I have
treated like a betrayer? [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Oh! Bevil, with what
words shall I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> There needs none; to convince is much more
than to conquer.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> But can you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> You have o'erpaid the inquietude you gave me,
in the change I see in you towards me. Alas! what
machines are we! thy face is altered to that of another
man; to that of my companion, my friend.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> That I could be such a precipitant wretch!</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Pray, no more.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Let me reflect how many friends have died, by
the hands of friends, for want of temper; and you must
give me leave to say again, and again, how much I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
beholden to that superior spirit you have subdued me
with. What had become of one of us, or perhaps both,
had you been as weak as I was, and as incapable of
reason?</p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> I congratulate to us both the escape from ourselves,
and hope the memory of it will make us dearer
friends than ever.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Dear Bevil, your friendly conduct has convinced
me that there is nothing manly but what is
conducted by reason, and agreeable to the practice of
virtue and justice. And yet how many have been sacrificed
to that idol, the unreasonable opinion of men!
Nay, they are so ridiculous in it, that they often use
their swords against each other with dissembled anger
and real fear.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Betrayed by honour, and compelled by shame,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They hazard being, to preserve a name:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor dare inquire into the dread mistake,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Till plunged in sad eternity they wake. [<i>Exeunt.</i></span><br />

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>St. James's Park.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sir John Bevil</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Sealand</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Give me leave, however, Mr. Sealand, as
we are upon a treaty for uniting our families, to mention
only the business of an ancient house. Genealogy and
descent are to be of some consideration in an affair of
this sort.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Genealogy and descent! Sir, there has
been in our family a very large one. There was Galfrid
the father of Edward, the father of Ptolomey, the father of
Crassus, the father of Earl Richard, the father of Henry
the Marquis, the father of Duke John.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> What, do you rave, Mr. Sealand? all these
great names in your family?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> These? yes, sir. I have heard my father
name 'em all, and more.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Ay, sir? and did he say they were all in
your family?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Yes, sir, he kept 'em all. He was the
greatest cocker<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> in England. He said Duke John won
him many battles, and never lost one.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Oh, sir, your servant! you are laughing at
my laying any stress upon descent; but I must tell you,
sir, I never knew anyone but he that wanted that
advantage turn it into ridicule.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> And I never knew any one who had many
better advantages put that into his account.&mdash;But, Sir
John, value yourself as you please upon your ancient
house, I am to talk freely of everything you are pleased
to put into your bill of rates on this occasion; yet, sir, I
have made no objections to your son's family. 'Tis his
morals that I doubt.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Sir, I can't help saying, that what might
injure a citizen's credit may be no stain to a gentleman's
honour.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Sir John, the honour of a gentleman is
liable to be tainted by as small a matter as the credit of
a trader. We are talking of a marriage, and in such a
case, the father of a young woman will not think it an
addition to the honour or credit of her lover that he is a
keeper&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Mr. Sealand, don't take upon you to spoil
my son's marriage with any woman else.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Sir John, let him apply to any woman else,
and have as many mistresses as he pleases.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> My son, sir, is a discreet and sober gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Sir, I never saw a man that wenched soberly
and discreetly, that ever left it off; the decency observed
in the practice hides, even from the sinner, the iniquity
of it. They pursue it, not that their appetites hurry 'em
away, but, I warrant you, because 'tis their opinion they
may do it.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Were what you suspect a truth&mdash;do you
design to keep your daughter a virgin till you find a man
unblemished that way?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Sir, as much a cit as you take me for, I
know the town and the world; and give me leave to
say, that we merchants are a species of gentry that have
grown into the world this last century, and are as
honourable, and almost as useful, as you landed folks,
that have always thought yourselves so much above
us; for your trading, forsooth, is extended no farther
than a load of hay or a fat ox. You are pleasant
people, indeed, because you are generally bred up to
be lazy; therefore, I warrant you, industry is dishonourable.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Be not offended, sir; let us go back to
our point.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Oh! not at all offended; but I don't love
to leave any part of the account unclosed. Look you,
Sir John, comparisons are odious, and more particularly
so on occasions of this kind, when we are projecting
races that are to be made out of both sides of the
comparisons.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> But, my son, sir, is, in the eye of the
world, a gentleman of merit.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> I own to you, I think him so.&mdash;But, Sir
John, I am a man exercised and experienced in chances
and disasters. I lost, in my earlier years, a very fine
wife, and with her a poor little infant. This makes me,
perhaps, over cautious to preserve the second bounty of
providence to me, and be as careful as I can of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
child. You'll pardon me, my poor girl, sir, is as valuable
to me as your boasted son to you.</p>

<p><i>Sir. J. Bev.</i> Why, that's one very good reason, Mr.
Sealand, why I wish my son had her.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> There is nothing but this strange lady
here, this <i>incognita</i>, that can be objected to him. Here
and there a man falls in love with an artful creature,
and gives up all the motives of life to that one
passion.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> A man of my son's understanding cannot
be supposed to be one of them.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Very wise men have been so enslaved;
and, when a man marries with one of them upon his
hands, whether moved from the demand of the world or
slighter reasons, such a husband soils with his wife for a
month perhaps&mdash;then good be w'ye, madam, the show's
over&mdash;Ah! John Dryden points out such a husband to a
hair, where he says,&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"And while abroad so prodigal the dolt is,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Poor spouse at home as ragged as a colt is."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Now, in plain terms, sir, I shall not care to have my
poor girl turned a-grazing, and that must be the case
when&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> But pray consider, sir, my son&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Look you, sir, I'll make the matter short.
This unknown lady, as I told you, is all the objection I
have to him; but, one way or other, he is, or has been,
certainly engaged to her. I am therefore resolved, this
very afternoon, to visit her. Now from her behaviour,
or appearance, I shall soon be let into what I may fear
or hope for.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Sir, I am very confident there can be
nothing inquired into relating to my son, that will not,
upon being understood, turn to his advantage.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> I hope that as sincerely as you believe it.&mdash;Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
John Bevil, when I am satisfied, in this great
point, if your son's conduct answers the character you
give him, I shall wish your alliance more than that of
any gentleman in Great Britain; and so your servant.
[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> He is gone in a way but barely civil; but
his great wealth, and the merit of his only child, the
heiress of it, are not to be lost for a little peevishness.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Humphry</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh! Humphry, you are come in a seasonable minute.
I want to talk to thee, and to tell thee that my head and
heart are on the rack about my son.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Sir, you may trust his discretion; I am sure
you may.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Why, I do believe I may, and yet I'm in
a thousand fears when I lay this vast wealth before me;
when I consider his prepossessions, either generous to a
folly, in an honourable love, or abandoned, past redemption,
in a vicious one; and, from the one or the other,
his insensibility to the fairest prospect towards doubling
our estate: a father, who knows how useful wealth is,
and how necessary, even to those who despise it&mdash;I say a
father, Humphry, a father cannot bear it.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Be not transported, sir; you will grow incapable
of taking any resolution in your perplexity.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Yet, as angry as I am with him, I would
not have him surprised in anything. This mercantile
rough man may go grossly into the examination of this
matter, and talk to the gentlewoman so as to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> No, I hope, not in an abrupt manner.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> No, I hope not! Why, dost thou know
anything of her, or of him, or of anything of it, or all
of it?</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> My dear master, I know so much that I told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
him this very day you had reason to be secretly out of
humour about her.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Did you go so far? Well, what said he
to that?</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> His words were, looking upon me steadfastly:
"Humphry," says he, "that woman is a woman of
honour."</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> How! Do you think he is married to
her, or designs to marry her?</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> I can say nothing to the latter; but he says
he can marry no one without your consent while you are
living.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> If he said so much, I know he scorns to
break his word with me.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> I am sure of that.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> You are sure of that&mdash;well! that's some
comfort. Then I have nothing to do but to see the
bottom of this matter during this present ruffle&mdash;Oh,
Humphry&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> You are not ill, I hope, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Yes, a man is very ill that's in a very ill-humour.
To be a father is to be in care for one whom
you oftener disoblige than please by that very care&mdash;Oh!
that sons could know the duty to a father before they
themselves are fathers&mdash;But, perhaps, you'll say now that
I am one of the happiest fathers in the world; but, I
assure you, that of the very happiest is not a condition
to be envied.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> Sir, your pain arises, not from the thing
itself, but your particular sense of it. You are overfond,
nay, give me leave to say, you are unjustly apprehensive
from your fondness. My master Bevil never
disobliged you, and he will, I know he will, do everything
you ought to expect.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> He won't take all this money with this
girl&mdash;For ought I know, he will, forsooth, have so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
moderation as to think he ought not to force his liking
for any consideration.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> He is to marry her, not you; he is to live
with her, not you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> I know not what to think. But, I know,
nothing can be more miserable than to be in this doubt&mdash;Follow
me; I must come to some resolution.
[<i>Exeunt.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bevil, Jun.'s</span> <i>Lodgings.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Phillis</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Well, madam, if you must speak with Mr.
Myrtle, you shall; he is now with my master in the
library.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> But you must leave me alone with him, for he
can't make me a present, nor I so handsomely take
anything from him before you; it would not be decent.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> It will be very decent, indeed, for me to retire,
and leave my mistress with another man.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> He is a gentleman, and will treat one properly.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I believe so; but, however, I won't be far off,
and therefore will venture to trust you. I'll call him to
you. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> What a deal of pother and sputter here is between
my mistress and Mr. Myrtle from mere punctilio!
I could, any hour of the day, get her to her lover, and
would do it&mdash;but she, forsooth, will allow no plot to get
him; but, if he can come to her, I know she would be
glad of it. I must, therefore, do her an acceptable violence,
and surprise her into his arms. I am sure I go
by the best rule imaginable. If she were my maid, I
should think her the best servant in the world for doing
so by me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Myrtle</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh sir! You and Mr. Bevil are fine gentlemen to let
a lady remain under such difficulties as my poor mistress,
and no attempt to set her at liberty, or release her from
the danger of being instantly married to Cimberton.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Tom has been telling&mdash;&mdash;But what is to be
done?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> What is to be done&mdash;when a man can't come at
his mistress! Why, can't you fire our house, or the next
house to us, to make us run out, and you take us?</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> How, Mrs. Phillis?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Ay; let me see that rogue deny to fire a house,
make a riot, or any other little thing, when there were
no other way to come at me.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I am obliged to you, madam.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Why, don't we hear every day of people's hanging
themselves for love, and won't they venture the
hazard of being hanged for love? Oh! were I a
man&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> What manly thing would you have me undertake,
according to your ladyship's notion of a man?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Only be at once what, one time or other, you
may be, and wish to be, or must be.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Dear girl, talk plainly to me, and consider I,
in my condition, can't be in very good humour&mdash;you
say, to be at once what I must be.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Ay, ay; I mean no more than to be an old
man; I saw you do it very well at the masquerade. In
a word, old Sir Geoffry Cimberton is every hour expected
in town, to join in the deeds and settlements
for marrying Mr. Cimberton. He is half blind, half
lame, half deaf, half dumb; though, as to his passions
and desires, he is as warm and ridiculous as when in the
heat of youth.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Come to the business, and don't keep the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
gentleman in suspense for the pleasure of being courted,
as you serve me.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> I saw you at the masquerade act such a one to
perfection. Go, and put on that very habit, and come
to our house as Sir Geoffry. There is not one there but
myself knows his person; I was born in the parish where
he is Lord of the Manor. I have seen him often and
often at church in the country. Do not hesitate, but
come hither; they will think you bring a certain security
against Mr. Myrtle, and you bring Mr. Myrtle.
Leave the rest to me; I leave this with you, and expect&mdash;They
don't, I told you, know you; they think you out
of town, which you had as good be for ever, if you lose
this opportunity&mdash;I must be gone; I know I am wanted
at home.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> My dear Phillis! [<i>Catches and kisses her, and
gives her money.</i></p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> O fie! my kisses are not my own; you have
committed violence; but I'll carry 'em to the right
owner. [<span class="smcap">Tom</span> <i>kisses her.</i>]&mdash;Come, see me downstairs [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Tom</span>.], and leave the lover to think of his last game for
the prize. [<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Phillis</span>.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> I think I will instantly attempt this wild expedient.
The extravagance of it will make me less suspected,
and it will give me opportunity to assert my own
right to Lucinda, without whom I cannot live. But I am
so mortified at this conduct of mine towards poor Bevil.
He must think meanly of me&mdash;I know not how to reassume
myself, and be in spirit enough for such an
adventure as this; yet I must attempt it, if it be only to
be near Lucinda under her present perplexities; and
sure&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The next delight to transport, with the fair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is to relieve her in her hours of care. [<i>Exit.</i></span><br />

<h3>ACT THE FIFTH.</h3>


<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sealand's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Phillis</span>, <i>with lights, before</i> <span class="smcap">Myrtle</span>, <i>disguised like
old</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Geoffry</span>; <i>supported by</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Sealand,
Lucinda</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Cimberton</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> Now I have seen you
thus far, Sir Geoffry, will you excuse
me a moment while I give my
necessary orders for your accommodation?
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Seal.</span></p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> I have not seen you,
cousin Cimberton, since you were
ten years old; and as it is incumbent on you to keep
up our name and family, I shall, upon very reasonable
terms, join with you in a settlement to that purpose.
Though I must tell you, cousin, this is the first merchant
that has married into our house.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Deuce on 'em! am I a merchant because my
father is? [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> But is he directly a trader at this time?</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> There's no hiding the disgrace, sir; he trades
to all parts of the world.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> We never had one of our family before who
descended from persons that did anything.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> Sir, since it is a girl that they have, I am, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
the honour of my family, willing to take it in again, and
to sink her into our name, and no harm done.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> 'Tis prudently and generously resolved&mdash;Is
this the young thing?</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Good madam, don't be out of humour, but let
them run to the utmost of their extravagance.&mdash;Hear
them out. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Luc.</span></p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Can't I see her nearer? My eyes are but weak.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Beside, I am sure the uncle has something
worth your notice. I'll take care to get off the young
one, and leave you to observe what may be wrought out
of the old one for your good. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Luc.</span> <i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> Madam, this old gentleman, your great uncle,
desires to be introduced to you, and to see you nearer!&mdash;Approach,
sir.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> By your leave, young lady. [<i>Puts on spectacles.</i>]&mdash;Cousin
Cimberton! She has exactly that
sort of neck and bosom for which my sister Gertrude
was so much admired in the year sixty-one, before the
French dresses first discovered anything in women below
the chin.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] What a very odd situation am I in!
though I cannot but be diverted at the extravagance of
their humours, equally unsuitable to their age&mdash;Chin,
quotha&mdash;I don't believe my passionate lover there knows
whether I have one or not. Ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Madam, I would not willingly offend, but I
have a better glass. [<i>Pulls out a large one.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Phillis</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Phil.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Cimberton</span>.] Sir, my lady desires to show
the apartment to you that she intends for Sir Geoffry.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> Well, sir! by that time you will have sufficiently
gazed and sunned yourself in the beauties of my spouse
there.&mdash;I will wait on you again. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Cimb.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Phil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></span></p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Were it not, madam, that I might be troublesome,
there is something of importance, though we are
alone, which I would say more safe from being heard.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> There is something in this old fellow, methinks,
that raises my curiosity. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> To be free, madam, I as heartily contemn this
kinsman of mine as you do, and am sorry to see so much
beauty and merit devoted by your parents to so insensible
a possessor.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Surprising!&mdash;I hope, then, sir, you will not contribute
to the wrong you are so generous as to pity,
whatever may be the interest of your family.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> This hand of mine shall never be employed to
sign anything against your good and happiness.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> I am sorry, sir, it is not in my power to make
you proper acknowledgments; but there is a gentleman
in the world whose gratitude will, I am sure, be worthy
of the favour.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> All the thanks I desire, madam, are in your
power to give.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Name them and command them.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Only, madam, that the first time you are alone
with your lover, you will, with open arms, receive him.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> As willingly as his heart could wish it.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Thus, then, he claims your promise. O
Lucinda!</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Oh! a cheat! a cheat! a cheat!</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Hush! 'tis I, 'tis I, your lover, Myrtle himself,
madam.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> O bless me! what a rashness and folly to surprise
me so&mdash;But hush&mdash;my mother.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Sealand, Cimberton</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Phillis</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> How now! what's the matter?</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> O madam! as soon as you left the room my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
uncle fell into a sudden fit, and&mdash;and&mdash;so I cried out
for help to support him and conduct him to his chamber.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> That was kindly done! Alas! sir, how
do you find yourself?</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Never was taken in so odd a way in my life&mdash;pray
lead me! Oh! I was talking here&mdash;(pray carry me)&mdash;to
my cousin Cimberton's young lady.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] My cousin Cimberton's young
lady! How zealous he is, even in his extremity, for the
match! A right Cimberton.
[<span class="smcap">Cimberton</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lucinda</span> <i>lead him, as one in pain.</i></p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> Pox! Uncle, you will pull my ear off.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Pray, uncle! you will squeeze me to death.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> No matter, no matter&mdash;he knows not what
he does.&mdash;Come, sir, shall I help you out?</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> By no means! I'll trouble nobody but my
young cousins here. [<i>They lead him off.</i></p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> But pray, madam, does your ladyship intend
that Mr. Cimberton shall really marry my young mistress
at last? I don't think he likes her.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> That's not material! Men of his speculation
are above desires&mdash;but be as it may. Now I have
given old Sir Geoffry the trouble of coming up to sign
and seal, with what countenance can I be off?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> As well as with twenty others, madam. It is
the glory and honour of a great fortune to live in continual
treaties, and still to break off: it looks great,
madam.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> True, Phillis&mdash;yet to return our blood
again into the Cimbertons is an honour not to be rejected&mdash;But
were not you saying that Sir John Bevil's
creature, Humphry, has been with Mr. Sealand?</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Yes, madam; I overheard them agree that Mr.
Sealand should go himself and visit this unknown lady
that Mr. Bevil is so great with; and if he found nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
there to fright him, that Mr. Bevil should still marry my
young mistress.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> How! nay, then, he shall find she is my
daughter as well as his. I'll follow him this instant, and
take the whole family along with me. The disputed
power of disposing of my own daughter shall be at an
end this very night. I'll live no longer in anxiety for a
little hussy that hurts my appearance wherever I carry
her: and for whose sake I seem to be at all regarded,
and that in the best of my days.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> Indeed, madam, if she were married, your ladyship
might very well be taken for Mr. Sealand's daughter.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> Nay, when the chit has not been with me,
I have heard the men say as much. I'll no longer cut
off the greatest pleasure of a woman's life (the shining in
assemblies) by her forward anticipation of the respect
that's due to her superior. She shall down to Cimberton-Hall&mdash;she
shall&mdash;she shall.</p>

<p><i>Phil.</i> I hope, madam, I shall stay with your ladyship.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> Thou shalt, Phillis, and I'll place thee then
more about me&mdash;But order chairs immediately; I'll be
gone this minute. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>Charing Cross.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Sealand</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Humphry</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> I am very glad, Mr. Humphry, that you
agree with me that it is for our common good I should
look thoroughly into this matter.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> I am, indeed, of that opinion; for there is no
artifice, nothing concealed, in our family, which ought in
justice to be known. I need not desire you, sir, to treat
the lady with care and respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Master Humphry, I shall not be rude,
though I design to be a little abrupt, and come into the
matter at once, to see how she will bear upon a surprise.</p>

<p><i>Humph.</i> That's the door, sir; I wish you success.&mdash;[<i>While</i>
<span class="smcap">Humphry</span> <i>speaks,</i> <span class="smcap">Sealand</span> <i>consults his table
book.</i>]&mdash;I am less concerned what happens there, because
I hear Mr. Myrtle is well lodged as old Sir Geoffry; so
I am willing to let this gentleman employ himself here,
to give them time at home; for I am sure 'tis necessary
for the quiet of our family Lucinda were disposed of out
of it, since Mr. Bevil's inclination is so much otherwise
engaged. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> I think this is the door. [<i>Knocks.</i>] I'll carry
this matter with an air of authority, to inquire, though I
make an errand, to begin discourse. [<i>Knocks again, and
enter a foot-boy.</i>] So young man! is your lady within?</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Alack, sir! I am but a country boy&mdash;I dant
know whether she is or noa; but an you'll stay a bit, I'll
goa and ask the gentlewoman that's with her.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Why, sirrah, though you are a country boy,
you can see, can't you? You know whether she is at
home, when you see her, don't you?</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Nay, nay, I'm not such a country lad neither,
master, to think she's at home because I see her. I
have been in town but a month, and I lost one place
already for believing my own eyes.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Why, sirrah! have you learnt to lie already?</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Ah, master! things that are lies in the country
are not lies at London. I begin to know my business a
little better than so&mdash;But an you please to walk in, I'll
call a gentlewoman to you that can tell you for certain&mdash;she
can make bold to ask my lady herself.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Oh! then, she is within, I find, though you
dare not say so.</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Nay, nay! that's neither here nor there: what's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
matter whether she is within or no, if she has not a mind
to see anybody?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> I can't tell, sirrah, whether you are arch or
simple; but, however, get me a direct answer, and here's
a shilling for you.</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Will you please to walk in; I'll see what I can
do for you.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> I see you will be fit for your business in
time, child; but I expect to meet with nothing but
extraordinaries in such a house.</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Such a house! Sir, you han't seen it yet. Pray
walk in.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Sir, I'll wait upon you. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Indiana's</span> <i>House.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Isabella</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Isab.</i> What anxiety do I feel for this poor creature!
What will be the end of her? Such a languishing unreserved
passion for a man that at last must certainly leave
or ruin her! and perhaps both! Then the aggravation
of the distress is, that she does not believe he will&mdash;not
but, I must own, if they are both what they would seem,
they are made for one another, as much as Adam and
Eve were, for there is no other of their kind but themselves.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Boy</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, Daniel! what news with you?</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Madam, there's a gentleman below would speak
with my lady.</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Sirrah! don't you know Mr. Bevil yet?</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Madam, 'tis not the gentleman who comes every
day, and asks for you, and won't go in till he knows
whether you are with her or no.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Ha! that's a particular I did not know before.
Well! be it who it will, let him come up to me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Boy</span>; <i>and re-enters with</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Sealand</span>;
<span class="smcap">Isabella</span> <i>looks amazed.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Madam, I can't blame your being a little
surprised to see a perfect stranger make a visit, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> I am indeed surprised!&mdash;I see he does not
know me. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> You are very prettily lodged here, madam;
in troth you seem to have everything in plenty&mdash;A thousand
a year, I warrant you, upon this pretty nest of
rooms, and the dainty one within them.
[<i>Aside, and looking about.</i></p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> [<i>Apart.</i>] Twenty years, it seems, have less effect
in the alteration of a man of thirty than of a girl of fourteen&mdash;he's
almost still the same; but alas! I find, by
other men, as well as himself, I am not what I was. As
soon as he spoke, I was convinced 'twas he; how shall
I contain my surprise and satisfaction! He must not
know me yet.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Madam, I hope I don't give you any disturbance;
but there is a young lady here with whom I
have a particular business to discourse, and I hope she
will admit me to that favour.</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Why, sir, have you had any notice concerning
her? I wonder who could give it you.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> That, madam, is fit only to be communicated
to herself.</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Well, sir! you shall see her.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] I find he
knows nothing yet, nor shall from me. I am resolved I
will observe this interlude, this sport of nature and of
fortune.&mdash;You shall see her presently, sir; for now I am
as a mother, and will trust her with you. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> As a mother! right; that's the old phrase
for one of those commode ladies, who lend out beauty
for hire to young gentlemen that have pressing occasions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
But here comes the precious lady herself. In troth a
very sightly woman&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Indiana</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Ind.</i> I am told, sir, you have some affair that requires
your speaking with me.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Yes, madam, there came to my hands a bill
drawn by Mr. Bevil, which is payable to-morrow; and
he, in the intercourse of business, sent it to me, who
have cash of his, and desired me to send a servant with
it; but I have made bold to bring you the money
myself.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Sir! was that necessary?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> No, madam; but to be free with you, the
fame of your beauty, and the regard which Mr. Bevil is
a little too well known to have for you, excited my
curiosity.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Too well known to have for me! Your sober
appearance, sir, which my friend described, made me
expect no rudeness, or absurdity, at least&mdash;&mdash;Who's
there?&mdash;Sir, if you pay the money to a servant, 'twill be
as well.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Pray, madam, be not offended; I came
hither on an innocent, nay, a virtuous design; and, if
you will have patience to hear me, it may be as useful
to you, as you are in a friendship with Mr. Bevil, as to
my only daughter, whom I was this day disposing of.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> You make me hope, sir, I have mistaken you. I
am composed again; be free, say on&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;what I
am afraid to hear.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> I feared, indeed, an unwarranted passion
here, but I did not think it was in abuse of so worthy an
object, so accomplished a lady as your sense and mien
bespeak; but the youth of our age care not what merit
and virtue they bring to shame, so they gratify&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Sir, you are going into very great errors; but as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
you are pleased to say you see something in me that has
changed at least the colour of your suspicions, so has your
appearance altered mine, and made me earnestly attentive
to what has any way concerned you to inquire into
my affairs and character.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> How sensibly, with what an air she talks!</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Good sir, be seated, and tell me tenderly; keep
all your suspicions concerning me alive, that you may in
a proper and prepared way acquaint me why the care of
your daughter obliges a person of your seeming worth
and fortune to be thus inquisitive about a wretched, helpless,
friendless&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Weeping.</i>] But I beg your pardon;
though I am an orphan, your child is not; and your concern
for her, it seems, has brought you hither.&mdash;I'll be
composed; pray go on, sir.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> How could Mr. Bevil be such a monster, to
injure such a woman?</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> No, sir, you wrong him; he has not injured me.
My support is from his bounty.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Bounty! when gluttons give high prices for
delicates, they are prodigious bountiful.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Still, still you will persist in that error. But my
own fears tell me all. You are the gentleman, I suppose,
for whose happy daughter he is designed a husband by
his good father, and he has, perhaps, consented to the
overture. He was here this morning, dressed beyond
his usual plainness&mdash;nay, most sumptuously&mdash;and he is
to be, perhaps, this night a bridegroom.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> I own he was intended such; but, madam,
on your account, I have determined to defer my
daughter's marriage till I am satisfied from your own
mouth of what nature are the obligations you are under to
him.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> His actions, sir; his eyes have only made me
think he designed to make me the partner of his heart.
The goodness and gentleness of his demeanour made me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
misinterpret all. 'Twas my own hope, my own passion,
that deluded me; he never made one amorous advance
to me. His large heart, and bestowing hand, have only
helped the miserable; nor know I why, but from his
mere delight in virtue, that I have been his care and
the object on which to indulge and please himself with
pouring favours.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Madam, I know not why it is, but I, as well
as you, am methinks afraid of entering into the matter I
came about; but 'tis the same thing as if we had talked
never so distinctly&mdash;&mdash;he ne'er shall have a daughter of
mine.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> If you say this from what you think of me, you
wrong yourself and him. Let not me, miserable though
I may be, do injury to my benefactor. No, sir, my treatment
ought rather to reconcile you to his virtues. If to
bestow without a prospect of return; if to delight in supporting
what might, perhaps, be thought an object of
desire, with no other view than to be her guard against
those who would not be so disinterested; if these actions,
sir, can in a careful parent's eye commend him to a
daughter, give yours, sir, give her to my honest, generous
Bevil. What have I to do but sigh, and weep, and rave,
run wild, a lunatic in chains, or, hid in darkness, mutter
in distracted starts and broken accents my strange,
strange story!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Take comfort, madam.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> All my comfort must be to expostulate in madness,
to relieve with frenzy my despair, and shrieking to
demand of fate why&mdash;why was I born to such variety of
sorrows.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> If I have been the least occasion&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> No, 'twas Heaven's high will I should be such; to
be plundered in my cradle! tossed on the seas! and even
there an infant captive! to lose my mother, hear but of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
my father! to be adopted! lose my adopter! then
plunged again into worse calamities!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> An infant captive!</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Yet then, to find the most charming of mankind,
once more to set me free from what I thought
the last distress, to load me with his services, his bounties,
and his favours; to support my very life in a way that
stole, at the same time, my very soul itself from me.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> And has young Bevil been this worthy
man?</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Yet then, again, this very man to take another!
without leaving me the right, the pretence of easing my
fond heart with tears! For, oh! I can't reproach him,
though the same hand that raised me to this height now
throws me down the precipice.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Dear lady! Oh, yet one moment's patience:
my heart grows full with your affliction.&mdash;But yet there's
something in your story that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> My portion here is bitterness and sorrow.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Do not think so. Pray answer me: does
Bevil know your name and family?</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Alas! too well! Oh, could I be any other thing
than what I am&mdash;&mdash;I'll tear away all traces of my former
self, my little ornaments, the remains of my first state,
the hints of what I ought to have been&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>In her disorder she throws away a bracelet, which</i>
<span class="smcap">Sealand</span> <i>takes up, and looks earnestly on it.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Ha! what's this? My eyes are not deceived!
It is, it is the same! the very bracelet which I
bequeathed to my wife at our last mournful parting.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> What said you, sir? Your wife? Whither does
my fancy carry me? What means this unfelt motion at
my heart? And yet, again my fortune but deludes me;
for if I err not, sir, your name is Sealand; but my lost
father's name was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Danvers; was it not?</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> What new amazement? That is, indeed, my
family.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Know, then, when my misfortunes drove me
to the Indies, for reasons too tedious now to mention, I
changed my name of Danvers into Sealand.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Isabella</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Isab.</i> If yet there wants an explanation of your wonder,
examine well this face (yours, sir, I well remember),
gaze on and read in me your sister, Isabella.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> My sister!</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> But here's a claim more tender yet&mdash;&mdash;your
Indiana, sir, your long-lost daughter.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Oh, my child! my child!</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> All gracious Heaven! is it possible! do I embrace
my father?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> And I do hold thee.&mdash;These passions are too
strong for utterance. Rise, rise, my child, and give my
tears their way.&mdash;Oh, my sister! [<i>Embracing her.</i></p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Now, dearest niece, my groundless fears, my
painful cares no more shall vex thee. If I have wronged
thy noble lover with too much suspicion, my just concern
for thee, I hope, will plead my pardon.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Oh! make him, then, the full amends, and
be yourself the messenger of joy. Fly this instant! tell
him all these wondrous turns of Providence in his favour!
Tell him I have now a daughter to bestow which he no
longer will decline; that this day he still shall be a bridegroom;
nor shall a fortune, the merit which his father
seeks, be wanting. Tell him the reward of all his virtues
waits on his acceptance. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Isab.</span>] My dearest
Indiana! [<i>Turns and embraces her.</i></p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Have I, then, at last, a father's sanction on my
love? His bounteous hand to give, and make my heart
a present worthy of Bevil's generosity?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Oh, my child! how are our sorrows past
o'erpaid by such a meeting! Though I have lost so
many years of soft paternal dalliance with thee, yet, in one
day to find thee thus, and thus bestow thee, in such perfect
happiness, is ample, ample reparation!&mdash;And yet,
again, the merit of thy lover&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Oh! had I spirits left to tell you of his actions!
how strongly filial duty has suppressed his love; and how
concealment still has doubled all his obligations; the
pride, the joy of his alliance, sir, would warm your heart,
as he has conquered mine.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> How laudable is love when born of virtue!
I burn to embrace him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> See, sir, my aunt already has succeeded, and
brought him to your wishes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Isabella</span>, <i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Sir John Bevil, Bevil, Jun.,
Mrs. Sealand, Cimberton, Myrtle</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lucinda</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> [<i>Entering.</i>] Where, where's this scene of
wonder? Mr. Sealand, I congratulate, on this occasion,
our mutual happiness&mdash;&mdash;Your good sister, sir, has, with
the story of your daughter's fortune, filled us with surprise
and joy. Now all exceptions are removed; my son has
now avowed his love, and turned all former jealousies
and doubts to approbation; and, I am told, your goodness
has consented to reward him.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> If, sir, a fortune equal to his father's hopes
can make this object worthy his acceptance.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> I hear your mention, sir, of fortune, with pleasure
only as it may prove the means to reconcile the best
of fathers to my love. Let him be provident, but let me
be happy.&mdash;My ever-destined, my acknowledged wife!
[<i>Embracing</i> <span class="smcap">Indiana</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ind.</i> Wife! Oh, my ever loved! My lord! my master!</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> I congratulate myself, as well as you, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
I had a son who could, under such disadvantages, discover
your great merit.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Oh, Sir John! how vain, how weak is human
prudence! What care, what foresight, what imagination
could contrive such blest events, to make our children
happy, as Providence in one short hour has laid before
us?</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Sealand</span>.] I am afraid, madam, Mr.
Sealand is a little too busy for our affair. If you please,
we'll take another opportunity.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> Let us have patience, sir.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> But we make Sir Geoffry wait, madam.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> O, sir, I am not in haste.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>During this,</i> <span class="smcap">Bev., Jun.</span>, <i>presents</i> <span class="smcap">Lucinda</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Indiana</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> But here! here's our general benefactor!
Excellent young man, that could be at once a lover to
her beauty and a parent to her virtue.</p>

<p><i>Bev. Jun.</i> If you think that an obligation, sir, give me
leave to overpay myself, in the only instance that can
now add to my felicity, by begging you to bestow this
lady on Mr. Myrtle.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> She is his without reserve; I beg he may
be sent for. Mr. Cimberton, notwithstanding you never
had my consent, yet there is, since I last saw you, another
objection to your marriage with my daughter.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> I hope, sir, your lady has concealed nothing
from me?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> Troth, sir, nothing but what was concealed
from myself&mdash;another daughter, who has an undoubted
title to half my estate.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> How, Mr. Sealand? Why, then, if half Mrs.
Lucinda's fortune is gone, you can't say that any of my
estate is settled upon her. I was in treaty for the whole;
but if that is not to be come at, to be sure there can be
no bargain. Sir, I have nothing to do but take my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
leave of your good lady, my cousin, and beg pardon for
the trouble I have given this old gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> That you have, Mr. Cimberton, with all my
heart. [<i>Discovers himself.</i></p>

<p><i>All.</i> Mr. Myrtle!</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> And I beg pardon of the whole company that I
assumed the person of Sir Geoffry, only to be present
at the danger of this lady being disposed of, and in her
utmost exigence to assert my right to her; which, if her
parents will ratify, as they once favoured my pretensions,
no abatement of fortune shall lessen her value to me.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Generous man!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Seal.</i> If, sir, you can overlook the injury of being
in treaty with one who has meanly left her, as you have
generously asserted your right in her, she is yours.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Mr. Myrtle, though you have ever had my
heart, yet now I find I love you more, because I bring
you less.</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> We have much more than we want; and I am
glad any event has contributed to the discovery of our
real inclinations to each other.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Seal.</i> Well! however, I'm glad the girl's disposed
of, anyway. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Bev.</i> Myrtle, no longer rivals now, but brothers!</p>

<p><i>Myrt.</i> Dear Bevil, you are born to triumph over me!
but now our competition ceases; I rejoice in the pre-eminence
of your virtue, and your alliance adds charms
to Lucinda.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Bev.</i> Now, ladies and gentlemen, you have set
the world a fair example: your happiness is owing to
your constancy and merit; and the several difficulties
you have struggled with evidently show&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Whate'er the generous mind itself denies,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The secret care of Providence supplies.</span><br />

<h3>(A FRAGMENT).</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>


<p><br /><i>The School of Action</i> was the play which
Steele was endeavouring to finish in
1723-5. The fragment which we have
would have required a great deal of
revising before it could have been put
upon the stage. The MS., from which
the piece was printed by Nichols, is
in the British Museum (Add. MS.,
5145c). It is not in Steele's writing, and the first few
leaves are now wanting. I have restored the original
reading in several instances in which Nichols made unnecessary
alterations. There are several memoranda on
the subject among the Blenheim MSS. Here is one of
them:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Minutes for the play itself.&mdash;First Act. The beginning
as I have it at Home in y<sup>e</sup> Scheme between Brainwell
and Lightfoot; after y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> calling over y<sup>e</sup> House w<sup>th</sup> the
actors, and y<sup>e</sup> severall purposes y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Playhouse might
be usefull for signified.&mdash;Act 2<sup>d.</sup> The Country family
wait as in an Inn at the playhouse; all that can be done
by the playhouse to terrifie y<sup>e</sup> Attorney and his Wife, and
all that can delight y<sup>e</sup> young Lady by Theatricall Powers
is exposed and explained. A Critick upon various Actions.&mdash;Act
3<sup>d.</sup> The Electra of Sophocles, where Mrs. Porter
is to be the Queen, and y<sup>e</sup> Tragedy of Sophocles to be
made y<sup>e</sup> Moddle is thoroughly set forth in a way
attempted to be truly sublime.&mdash;Act 4<sup>th.</sup> The Country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
Family, knowing of the Murder done there, resolved to
bear Witness of it and prosecute it according to Law."
And again, "Let Booth be Orestes, with all the prepossession
and love of His Mother with the necessity upon
Him of killing Her, and resolving upon it all of a sudden
from passion to passion in an Hurry,&mdash;yet commanding all
his Resentments to execute His design.&mdash;His regard for
His sister and her urging Him." The following are other
rough notes:&mdash;"Jenky to be instructed to be a ghost and
torment His Brother&mdash;not to be y<sup>t</sup> of Hamlet. Johnson
to be the false Brother&mdash;Mrs. Willis, His Wife, urging to
give up.&mdash;They miss the young lady for 2<sup>d.</sup> Act&mdash;but don't
value so y<sup>t</sup> Her fortune is safe in His hands.... Let
Pinsars ramble from place to place, and getting clear of
the Play House&mdash;where he meets Evill Constable (?) and
His Mirmidons.&mdash;Then Buntho's Ghost and all the other
incidents possible&mdash;appears still in y<sup>e</sup> House, and gives up
to Severn, &amp;c." And again:&mdash;"Introduce a Woman,
Drunk, to be acted by Cibber, to talk at beginning Lewdly
in a Mask, y<sup>e</sup> rest in Whisper. Let Pinsars be assisted by
an Army of y<sup>e</sup> Playhouse to fight his way out; he and his
man Ralph and his Wife Striking all in earnest, assisted
by the Constable.... Let Him Threaten to demolish
the Whore of Babylon&mdash;Speak of the Dragon and all the
Cant of the Presbyterian Zeal against Plays, &amp;c., but
fight.... For the Prologue take notice of this play as a
<i>Posthumous Work</i> according to Dr. Partridge's freinds.
Spider and Dotterell's Quality: Beasts made before men&mdash;Therefore
the Dotterells must give way, for they were
made before Spiders were in being, and not made before
they were men."</p>

<p>The following notes evidently refer to another piece:&mdash;"To
take the play y<sup>t</sup> Lyes in loose parts in my Scrutoire
and lay it together for the Stage: To ridicule y<sup>e</sup> whole
Mechanick of Dr. Faustus, &amp;c., and all things of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>kind for y<sup>e</sup> Theatre&mdash;make persons to play tricks, break
necks, and the like.... There is no true nobility but in
the practise of Vertue and right reason, where there is
nothing can be little.... Make him go to his certain
Ruin for want of knowledge in a Circumstance he might
know if he had looked into a letter w<sup>ch</sup> contains a secret
Contrived against him, but he cannot pry into because it
comes into his Hands unwarrantably: make this y<sup>e</sup> great
Incident of his distress.... To ridicule our Slavery to
Italian Musick, to have an ode of Anacreon set in Greek
performed. To observe upon y<sup>e</sup> absurdity of making
distresses and mirth for y<sup>e</sup> Vulgar out of y<sup>e</sup> Accidents y<sup>t</sup>
befall the body, as in the play of <i>The Chances</i>: The old
Woman in her Colick pains toothless and defective through
age is exposed as a Jest."</p>

<h3><i>THE SCHOOL OF ACTION.</i></h3>


<h3>ACT THE FIRST.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Severn</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Humber</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sev.</i> The world is much more easily
imposed upon, than you studious and
modest men imagine.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Dear Severn, if such superficial
qualifications as you talk of will
accomplish gentlemen and ladies, I own
to you, hard has been our fate, in having suffered pains
and penalties (fit only for malefactors) in great schools,
and been immured in college the best years of life, to acquire
learning and attain to sciences that are all useless
when we come into the world.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Pardon me, dear Humber, I did not say useless;
I only argue that you had better, to make your fortune,
have ordinary qualifications, such as a good mien,
common understanding, and an easy address, than great
faculties and talents under the oppression of bashfulness,
rusticity, or&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Or knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> It shall be or knowledge if you please&mdash;if you
mean knowledge kept to a man's self, or in a man's
keeping, that is afraid or ashamed to exert it.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Well, be it as you propose; go on.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> I say, then, your taste for books and fine writing,
your judgment in the faculties of the soul, my town education,
and skill in the airs, motions, graces, and abilities
of the body, will enable us to carry on this our design of
supporting a new playhouse, and keeping a School of
Action.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Well, if we break&mdash;I can go down again to my
fellowship at Oxford, and laugh and be laughed at among
a parcel of worthy and ingenious men, whom I will entertain
with my adventures; and I think the undertaking
cannot but introduce at least matter of humour and
mirth: if it does not advance our fortunes, it will
heighten our conversation.&mdash;But to your School of
Action.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> As all that reside in inns of court and universities,
though they do not enter into any of the learned professions,
are yet better accomplished for any other ways of
life by having the same education with those who go into
them; so will all who come to our School of Action be
better qualified in their own characters, by being instructed
among players, who are taught to become any
part which shall be imposed upon them.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Thou art a rare sanguine fellow to think this
will do. But I have observed confidence in a man's
self that he shall perform a thing, helps him forward
better than any other quality about him&mdash;Well, hang it,
in order to make this experiment, I will be as enterprising
and confident as you.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Let me, then, observe one thing, for fear of your
relapsing into your academic shyness; that you must beware
of standing as if you were a thinking statue, a case
for a spirit to reflect in, and not a mind and body acting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
together. You improve the soul only in your colleges&mdash;you
neglect the body.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Thou art in the right: I have studied eloquence
till I am dumb.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> I am glad you see your want and infirmity. If
you will speak, I know you will talk well. I know when
you are unreservedly familiar you talk very well, as you
did t'other night concerning the principles of motion and
rest. Suppose, as you are resolved to talk, you would
resolve also to move, and practise a little local motion.
Give me leave to show you how you perform it. Go to
the other side of the stage. [<i>He walks thither.</i>] Thus
you walked&mdash;thus your shoulders&mdash;thus your legs&mdash;thus
your breast&mdash;thus your hips.&mdash;Pray adventure back again&mdash;thus&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Pish! I am a little hurt, and grow peevish with
this mimicry; though I believe you are right enough.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Well, I only show you: it is not necessary you
should, as to the present purpose, be jaunty; you
are to mind more important matters. You are censor,
observe, upon the sense and spirit of what is said; leave
the manner of doing it to me, the prompter.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> But, as you are picking up people from all
quarters, are the old gentleman and his lady, the young
girl, and the maid and man, who came hither last night,
all to be players? and why are they accommodated here
in the tiring-room, as if it were an ordinary lodging?</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> You shall know all in due time and order. Ho!&mdash;Harry!&mdash;Who
waits there? [<i>Enters a</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>.] Is
the whole house come?</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> They are all here, sir, except the thunderer and
the candle-snuffer; they say it is a mistake, and that they
are never required to come to rehearsal.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Tell them they shall forfeit; the thunderer shall
pay two groats; they&mdash;they shall be fined a day's pay.
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>.]&mdash;My dear friend, while the company is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
assembling in the several apartments, I will explain
further: You are to know that old master Pincers is a
rich northern attorney, who understands the law much
better as it is the business of it to punish offenders, than
as it is to protect the innocent. The young girl is a
ward left under his care, and has a very considerable
estate in that country. He has brought her up to town
to settle her.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> In the playhouse?</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Pray, hear. In the playhouse? no. Of all
things in nature, stage-plays (as he calls them) are his
aversion. But they are no less Miss Dolly's delight. As
I had my education, that is to say, ate and drank, conversed
and lay some years every night at Gray's Inn, I
made a notable pleader before our bench of justices in
Cumberland, and grew very intimate with Mr. Pincers.
He took such a fancy to my promising parts&mdash;for, you
must know, I pretended to be a rogue to gain his good-will&mdash;that,
with a hint of five hundred pounds reward
for my share in the transaction, he communicated to me
a design of disposing of this young lady by way of sale.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Good&mdash;and thought you a proper broker to find
out a husband, or rather a purchaser.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Right. "Mr. Severn," said he, "you know there
is nothing more common than to observe that orphans
are a prey, by reason of their great wealth, and marry
unhappily."</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> And therefore&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> And therefore he would have a receipt for <i>all</i> her
fortune, for delivering <i>half</i> of it to the man who should
marry her&mdash;"which," said he, "shall be no fraud to the
gentleman; for he shall settle only an equivalent for ten
thousand pounds, which is the moiety. By this means,"
continued my conscientious friend, "I shall observe how
he behaves to this poor girl; and can, if he deserves it,
leave the other moiety to them by my will."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> And what did you say to this hopeful project?</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> I fell in with it, and promised to find him a right
young fellow for his purpose.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Did you so, sir? [<i>As going.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Now you grow a mere scholar again.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> An honest gentleman is a mere scholar where
a sharper is a wit&mdash;I will leave your accursed town
to-night.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> I will convince you that there is nothing mean or
dishonourable on my part; but a lucky incident I should
be stupid not to take hold of.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Say it; but your prologue is so long, you seem
to know that the plot of your play is not easily to be
defended.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> You cannot say that till you know it. I agreed
with him to find a young gentleman suitable to her, who
shall bring as good an estate as she shall, and settle all
upon her and the children of the marriage.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Well&mdash;who is the gentleman whom you have
thought of to do this? On whom will you bestow the
poor innocent girl who has never injured you?</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Why, I have been thinking that over and over;
and it is so hard to look into another's breast, that one
may, after all appearances, be mistaken; and, therefore,
I have resolved upon the only man who I was sure was
honest&mdash;even my own proper self.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> You are most conscientiously impartial and
disinterested.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> I think myself conscientious, though neither impartial
nor disinterested. I consider that he would certainly
sell her elsewhere on his own terms, without regard
to her happiness. In my hands she will have her estate
her own, with the incumbrance only of a man who loves
her, and whom I believe she loves, and who may increase
that estate for her. Consider, he would do what he
designed, whether I would or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> I consider you will do what you design, whether
I will or not. Nay, further, I cannot but own the circumstances
much alleviate the guilt on your part. Nay,
if you fairly get the girl's good-will, I will allow your
attempt not only excusable, but praiseworthy.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> There spoke my good genius.&mdash;In the country, as
much as he trusted me in the secret of cheating her, he
never let me see her alone, or without witnesses; his
wife, the maid, or man, or all of them, were constantly
present. But, as she is a great lover and reader of plays,
and of a great deal of wit and humour, we could speak
one language and look another, above their knowledge
or observation. I sent for him to town in order to marry
her, insisting on my five hundred pounds; for he would
not trust me, did he not know my price. I have lodged
all here, whence they shall never go out till dear miss
implores it of me, or has justice done her by me or
somebody to her liking.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> There you justify all the art you can use for
yourself. And may you win and wear her, since you plot
her redemption though yourself should not succeed!</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Well, we have done talking; let us to action. My
business is to review my forces, and not neglect my main
plot, but consider my playhouse and my mistress at the
same time; and, while I am preparing the one, make
love to the other.&mdash;Here, Jack, call all the actors&mdash;let
the whole house march.&mdash;Tragedy drums and trumpets,
fifes, kettledrums and clarions shall wake my country
lodgers, fright my old parchment, and charm my little
northern pilgrim&mdash;my dear refugee&mdash;I will understand
her no other. Beat, sound, and play. Make all people
be in their posts round the stage, and answer in all parts
to the stage.&mdash;All shall be done that can be to make her
pass her time pleasantly. She shall always expect to see
me, but not see me till I have abundant convincing proofs
that I am in her favour. Thus if I can save her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
save her for myself, it will be an exquisite happiness; if
not, to save her from this rascal is but my duty. Oh! I
should have told you that when Miss Dolly came in, I
conveyed a letter into her pocket, intimating where she
was, that she may be surprised at nothing; for I love the
dear thing so tenderly that I could not give her the
shortest uneasiness, to purchase the most lasting good or
pleasure to myself. [<i>Here begins the march.</i>] Hist!</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> [<i>Within.</i>] Ho! chamberlain, bring me my
boots&mdash;where is the chamberlain?&mdash;What is the
noise?&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ralph</i> [<i>Within.</i>] The drums.</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> What is the matter?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> The train-bands, belike, master.</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> Ho! chamberlain!</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> While the rest of the country family are thus
deceived, Dolly is let into the whole matter, and won't
be surprised at anything. If she humours the deceit it
is a good symptom on your side.&mdash;This must be a fruitful
circumstance of mirth.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Nymphs, shepherds, ghosts, angels, and demons,
shall tease the old rascal; and all the while Miss Dolly
see and hear nothing but according to the notice I have
given her.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> While you are thus busied about your people,
and managing your design, which I have not much taste
for (I want that mercury about me), I will go about the
house and view the accommodations&mdash;they say it is the
most convenient one in the world.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Sir, take your humour; I will pursue mine, and
call you when the circumstance is above my reach. [<i>Exit</i>
<span class="smcap">Humber</span>.] Well, march by; let the kings take place of
all the people, next them bishops, then judges&mdash;no, we
had as good not to discompose their dresses. [<i>Among
the march of the actors he observes</i> <span class="smcap">Will Dotterell</span>.] Ho!
Mr. Dotterell, Mr. Dotterell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dot.</i> Sir! Your most humble servant, good Mr.
Severn. What, have you a part for me in your new
play? It was you that first thought of making an actor
of me, and I have gained some reputation; and, harkee,
you have made a deal of me, I can tell you.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Ay, ay, I know thou art a town favourite&mdash;thy
name is not spoken of but it raises mirth. Let us
see, what parts have you acted? You have acted all
manner of things as well as persons. You began, I
think, a flower-pot, in <i>Dioclesian</i><a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>; then you have performed
another ingenious part, been a chair, I think, at
another opera; you have represented all the appetites&mdash;as
I take it, you do hunger best, you are a fine fellow at
a cold chicken&mdash;Then you have been all sorts of trades,
but you shine most in the tailor in <i>Epsom Wells</i><a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>, you
beat your wife most successfully.</p>

<p><i>Dot.</i> It was thought I laid her on as well as another,
for you may remember she was a bitter one, and she
provoked me some six or seven drubs beyond what the
poet writ for her.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Well, look you, Will, I design greater things for
you than any poet of them all; why, you shall act a ghost
in the ensuing play.</p>

<p><i>Dot.</i> A ghost of me! No, it can never be.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Yes, yes, you oaf, you shall be a country ghost.
You shall come to the country gentleman who lay here
last night in the figure of his deceased brother, a fat
justice of the peace, who left all his money in his hands&mdash;and
he cheats him. Why, I don't know but you may
be the luckiest ghost that ever appeared. Who knows
but the old rascal may repent and pay you? If he does
I'm sure you'll take it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dot.</i> Nay, nay, there's no doubt of that. What has
the poor money done? I will take it, as you say.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Look you there: when you have done this part
you are a most accomplished player, you have gone
through all the degrees of action. You came out of the
parsley-bed, as they say to the children; you have been
everything&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dot.</i> A ghost! I shall never be sober enough.
What if it be a country ghost&mdash;yet every man is
serious after his death. I shall certainly laugh, and
discover all.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Well, bid him they call Dicky come to me.</p>

<p><i>Dot.</i> Dicky, Dicky, come to me; come, Dicky,
come to Mr. Severn. I am not a ghost yet; you need
not be afraid.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Spider</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Mr. Spider, I have a part for you; but I am
afraid you have too good an air, too much dignity in your
person, to do it well.</p>

<p><i>Spi.</i> Oh, I warrant you they never put me to act anything
in tragedy, though my genius and temper is
altogether for great and sublime things.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> No doubt on't, Mr. Spider, but you must be content
at present to do me a courtesy, and still keep in
comedy; for you are to be a tapster.</p>

<p><i>Spi.</i> What! when Mr. Dotterell (as I apprehend) is to
be a ghost, am I to be but a tapster?</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Why, you are to be a tapster to the inn in which
he is to be a ghost, so that he's in a manner in your
keeping. All the ghosts in inns are kept there by the
tapster or chamberlain; now you are to be both in this
inn that I imagine.</p>

<p><i>Spi.</i> Oh! oh! I begin to conceive you. I am to be
a live tapster, and Mr. Dotterell is to be the ghost of a
dead man that died in the inn and left a power of money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
behind, and so haunts the house because his own cousin
had not&mdash;I understand it very well&mdash;Look you, Mr.
Dotterell, it was I and my master contrived to kill this
gentleman for the great bag of money he brought into
our house. Come, come, we'll go in and consider how
to act these parts, without giving Mr. Severn any more
trouble about it.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> But there is another thing that, I fear, will go
much against you; and that is, you are to be excessively
saucy.</p>

<p><i>Spi.</i> No, I shall make no scruple of that if he proves an
unmannerly guest, I'll warrant you.&mdash;But, Mr. Dotterell,
let us go and lay our heads together.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Now, gentlemen, you are going out in your own
persons, and no man living can tell which of you should
take place. Certainly, Mr. Spider, you are somebody or
other; and, Mr. Dotterell, so are you. Now I would fain
know which of you is to take place.</p>

<p><i>Spi.</i> Pray, good Mr. Dotterell.</p>

<p><i>Dot.</i> Nay, nay, Mr. Spider, I'll never be outdone in
civility; you must pardon me, indeed, sir.</p>

<p><i>Spi.</i> Nay, sir.</p>

<p><i>Dot.</i> Nay, sir.</p>

<p><i>Spi.</i> Nay, sir.</p>

<p><i>Dot.</i> Nay, nay, nay, sir, if you go to that.
[<i>Turns aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Spi.</i> Nay, but, good sir&mdash;excuse me, sir.
[<i>Turning another way.</i></p>

<p><i>Dot.</i> Oh, Mr. Spider, your servant for that, sir.
[<i>Takes him up in his arms.</i></p>

<p><i>Spi.</i> Sir, you conquer me beyond expression; sir, you
run away with me.</p>

<p><i>Dot.</i> Indeed, sir, I must say you are a very easy gentleman;
you are carried away with the least civility, look
you, sir; for&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Carrying
him backwards and forwards.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Spi.</i> Plague on't, what a misfortune it is to be a little
fellow! Though I have a soul as great as Hercules, this
fellow can deal with me.</p>

<p><i>Dot.</i> Oh, my dear little Dicky Spider!
[<i>Exit, kicking him in his arms.</i></p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> [<i>Solus</i>]. Here's a great piece of difficulty adjusted;
but I observe very few difficulties of ceremony of much
greater moment than this, and wish they were all to be
so ended. Well, now have I the hardest task in all my
affair to pursue: To persuade a woman who is young,
pleasant, and agreeable, to act a part for me to another;
to make love for me, instead of receiving love made to
her; and there is no way of obtaining of 'em but by
making love to them. They are used to no other
language, and understand no other.&mdash;Ho! who waits
there?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Waiter</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Waiter.</i> Sir; do you call, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Pray, sir, call Mrs. Umbrage hither. If she
be in the green-room, tell her I beg to speak with
her&mdash;I must form myself into all the good humour I
can to entertain her, or I shall never get her to come
into it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Umbrage</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh, here she comes.&mdash;Well, madam, I have cast parts
for you, and named you to many, but never so very nice
a one as I am to desire of you to undertake at present.
To overlook yourself and deliver the application made to
another which had been more rightly directed to yourself,
is a greatness of mind&mdash;is a candour, to be found only in
Mrs. Umbrage.</p>

<p><i>Umb.</i> Well, Mr. Severn, you have waved your cap
sufficiently; you have done homage and made your
acknowledgments; pray proceed to the matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> The northern young lady you have often heard
me talk of, is in town, and lay in this house last night.</p>

<p><i>Umb.</i> That has been the conversation of the green-room.&mdash;But
what do you design in all this you are going
to let me into?</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> I would be well with that young lady. Nay, I
think I am so.</p>

<p><i>Umb.</i> A man may often be mistaken in those points,
as knowing as you are.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> I grant it, madam; I have a mind to know it
more explicitly, and have the most evident proofs of it;
which I will not desire till I have given her sufficient
testimony of a disinterested zeal and service for her.</p>

<p><i>Umb.</i> That is, indeed, the noblest and the surest way
to approach a sensible spirit, as I have heard you describe
hers to be. Pray let me hear what argument you have
for thinking she has a disposition towards you; for you
know we naturally are too apt to believe what we wish.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> A good opinion is in a man's own power to
create. I took care to appear in the best manner where
she was; to be always in great good humour, and show a
wonderful deference to her in all my actions; which I
constantly expressed by my eye only, as afraid of notice
and observation. She had her eyes as attentive to mine,
and she never lost the least expression that I made to
her, but turned away her eyes when mine grew too familiar.&mdash;But
give me leave to tell you one particular occasion
wherein I plainly think she declared herself to me.</p>

<p><i>Umb.</i> That will be worth hearing indeed; I shall be
glad to hear the language of the eyes translated by the
tongue. [<i>Smiling.</i></p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> You are to know, madam, that there happened
one day in the north, a great Quaker's wedding at which
she and I were present. They went with the greatest
gravity and decorum through the whole circumstance of
it. But at night she was invited, so was I, to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
bride and bridegroom put to bed. Several of her maidens
attended her; several of their young men him. It is
the nature of their superstition to keep their passions
bridled, restrained, and formally dissembled. They have
none of those flights, palpitations, gambols, and follies,
which divert the mind and break it from its main object.</p>

<p><i>Umb.</i> You are going into a fine story; but I must trust
your discretion.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Madam, you may. [<i>Bowing.</i>] To be sure, the
bridegroom is laid by his bride; the company stands in
the most profound silence, as contemplating the objects
before them; he a young man of twenty-five, she a
young woman of twenty; he wishing our absence; she
fearing it. The eyes of everyone of us spectators naturally
searching the object with which they could best be
pleased in the same condition, my eyes met Miss Pincers',
in which there was such a sweet compliance, such a revel
invitation, immediately checked when observed and
answered by me, that I have ever since concluded that
she had something more than goodwill for me.</p>

<p><i>Umb.</i> Well, if she has it, I shall be far from lessening
it; but will, as you seem to desire, accompany her, and
improve it.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> I form great hopes of success from that declaration;
but as the lady is mighty theatrically disposed, I
beseech you to show her the pleasure and beauties of the
house.</p>

<p><i>Umb.</i> All that is in my power; all that is not I must
leave to you.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> I will not doubt of success.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To gain a she, a sure she-friend provide;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For woman is to woman the best guide.</span><br />

<h3>ACT THE SECOND.</h3>

Ralph</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Margery</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Pin.</i> Fie, Miss Dolly; do you say you
heard no manner of noise when
I was knocking my heart out?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> None in the least. In the
country they talked of the rattling
of coaches here in London. I heard
nothing of it; I can hardly think I
am yet in the City.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pin.</i> Why, Miss Dolly, you won't say so, sure!
Did you hear no drums nor trumpets?</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Not in the least.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pin.</i> O gemini! Then, to be sure, the house is
haunted, and the man of the inn has killed some
traveller, and hid him behind the hangings, and we are
all disturbed for it&mdash;'tis so to be sure.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> It is no otherwise. I wonder Counsellor
Severn would bring master to such an inn as this is,
so I do.</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> Chamberlain! why, chamberlain!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Spider</span> (<i>as</i> Chamberlain).</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Spi.</i> Do you call, sir?</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> Do you call, sir? Ay, marry do I, sir. What has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
been doing in the inn here, or in the streets, with
trumpets and kettle-drums?</p>

<p><i>Spi.</i> Trumpets and kettle-drums! Poor gentleman!</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> Poor gentleman! no, no poor gentleman.&mdash;I am
afraid this house is no better than it should be.</p>

<p><i>Spi.</i> Has not your worship lain warm? The bed is as
good a bed as any in the house. A man of fifteen hundred
a-year lay in it, and slept all night. He came to
town to be fluxed. He was very much a gentleman, and
owned he slept very well; and his bones ached but little
in that easy bed.</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> Rogue! put honest folks, that have been man
and wife these twenty years, into a p&mdash;&mdash; bed
together!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pin.</i> In a p&mdash;&mdash; bed, husband! Take the law
of him.</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> Sirrah! has not Counsellor Severn been here this
morning? Go, sirrah, bring me some water and a towel;
I'll go to the Counsellor's chambers immediately. I'll
trounce this house. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Spider</span>.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I'll look over my letter again. [<i>Reads.</i>]
"Be afraid of nothing; but know, that the disagreeable
shapes Mr. Pincers is entertained with are not to appear
to you; and when you know this, you may partake of
that diversion of tormenting those who attempt only to
sell and betray you. What you see are persons and
appearances belonging to the several plays which are
acted in this house."&mdash;Oh me! how pure is all this!</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> Harkee, Mr. Barber; you look like an honest
man, put on your trimming cloths about me. I'll inquire
of you what sort of people live in this house&mdash;Ha! what's
this here?</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> What does this mean? A letter come directed
to me out of the air&mdash;and my brother coming! Wife!
Margery, do you see that letter? What can it mean?
Look you, sauce-box; good man, Tapster, I shall take a
course with you, sirrah, I shall.</p>

<p><i>Spi.</i> You are a sneaking country bumpkin, sir.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dotterell</span>, <i>dressed like a Country Squire.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Pin.</i> Bless us! there comes on my brother, in his old
boots and grey riding-coat. 'Tis he: I ha'n't the heart
to speak to it.</p>

<p><i>Dot.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] A country ghost! I shall laugh out.
How frightened the dog is! I'll warrant the rogue has a
great sum of money of mine. I'll make him give it me.&mdash;[<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Pincers</span>.] Repent, and don't cheat your brother,
and break your word with a man that is dead and buried.&mdash;I
shall laugh before the old put has refunded&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pin.</i> There is the justice come to fetch us away
with him&mdash;he's come for Dolly's portion.&mdash;You know I
was always for giving it all to her since Nancy's death.</p>

<p><i>Dot.</i> Give me my money&mdash;give me my money.</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> Oh! how I tremble! yet dare not speak to him.
[<i>He comes nearer.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dot.</i> Show my last will and testament. Give me my
money.</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> I cannot speak to him, to tell him I'll do everything.</p>

<p><i>Dot.</i> I will haunt thee, and tear thy wife from the
fell&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pin.</i> He presents the figure of the poor child we
had to cheat Dolly with! Oh, husband, he'll have me to
punish thy sins! Oh, he has me, now, now, husband!
[<i>They both sink with the</i> Barber <i>at a trap-door.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> "He presents the figure of the poor child we
had to cheat Dolly with!" How shall I get off this
ground. [<i>Going away, fearfully.</i></p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> Oh, Ralph! can you leave me?
[<i>They meet trembling, as if they found the place open.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Let us keep together, and not go underground
in a strange place.</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> Tell me, Ralph, whether there was anything
between you and Nan?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Ask no questions, ask no questions, good
Margery. [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> Whither shall I go, or where will this adventure
end? Sure, Mr. Severn will&mdash;&mdash;</p>

madam, you forgot Lorenzo that you mentioned just
now: you must see his&mdash;[<i>Whistle. Scene changes.</i>] there,
madam, there's the place he spoke those charming words
in. But I forget, madam, you are a country lady, and
delight rather in airy prospects, tracts of land, and

Birdcage Walk, where lovers meet for intrigue?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Umb.</i> You shall see it in due time; for I have a thousand
other things to tell you of. You must understand
human life, and what passes in the world, before you give
yourself away.&mdash;But I must not inform you of it abruptly
and hastily.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> It will be charitable in you, madam, to do so.</p>

<p><i>Umb.</i> I know you must be an admirer of poetry and
good sense, without which music is insipid, or at least but
half-informed.</p>

<p><i>Dolly.</i> I have wished myself at London a thousand
times, to see operas; but I would not have them sing
nonsense.</p>

<p><i>Umb.</i> Therefore, madam, I hope you'll like the poetry
which Mr. Severn has ordered for the stage in celebration
of two faithful lovers: they were persons in an humble
condition, and no ways conspicuous but by their passion
for each other; indeed, just what they should be
conspicuous for&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h3>ACT THE THIRD.</h3>

</blockquote>

<p><i>Sev.</i> I have often begged you to let me
shift for myself, let my character sink
or swim. Every man who attempts
any new thing must allow mankind to
talk of him as they please. I do
not regard what the world says, but
what they should say.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> It is very odd that we have never happy moments
but at midnight, so different are our tempers; and we are
made to keep together from no other rule, but that we
never expostulate upon past mistakes; to meet again
after a misunderstanding, contains in itself all manner of
apology, all expostulation; but, if I might, I would complain
that the business of the house is neglected while
you are attending your amours.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> No; there is a present leisure to attend anything
of that kind, to hear any person or persons that pretend
to the stage, to examine scenes or goods to be shown or
exhibited there, and give them their answers.&mdash;Let us
take our places accordingly.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> It is wondrous to consider the folly of mankind,
that think so lightly and so meanly of the faculties of a
player.&mdash;Roscius had three thousand scholars, and but
one only fit for the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> There's no arguing mankind out of their humour
or their taste; they may be gained upon by skill and
labour, but that must be felt before it's seen.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Now you begin to philosophise: but let us hear
the people, in spite of vernacular dialect or tone, attempting
to represent the most difficult characters of state.
Mr. Duntaxat, if you please, we will now sit down and
hear them. [<i>They sit down at table accordingly.</i>] Mr.
Severn, you see he consents to take out places. [<i>Rings
the bell.</i>] Who waits?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Servant.</i> A great many people, sir; but none so importunate
to be admitted as the Welsh gentleman,
who offers to act the character of Hamlet for his own
pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Plague on him, whose pleasure will it be
besides?</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Oh, all the world will like him; let us admit him
by all means.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> He, in his vernacular tone, will disparage a scene
forever by repeating it; but do as you will.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Pray desire the gentleman to walk in: pray,
gentlemen, keep your countenance, for he is no fool; or
if he is, he is a valiant one, and hath a great estate half-way
up the atmosphere.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Gwillyn</span>.</p>

<p>[<i>They all rise from their seats.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p>Sir, we understand the high obligation you lay upon
us (pray sit down, sir) in condescending to tread the
stage in the character of the Prince of Denmark; in
which, sir, you are so far right, that he was a prince of
a very ancient family, and not unworthy a gentleman of
your character to represent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Gwil.</i> I have a respect for him, both for his plutt and
his prains, and think I could do him justice.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> There is no doubt of it, good sir; and if you
please to pronounce the sentence, "To be and not to be,"
you'll mightily raise these gentlemen's expectations and
gratitude to you for the favour you intend them.</p>

<p><i>Gwil.</i> Sir, that will I do, if the gentlemen please to
hear it. [<i>They all rise, and come forward with him.</i></p>

<p><i>Gwil.</i> "To pee and not to pee," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Most admirably spoke, sir. Be pleased to give
us time to concert measures what day to act this play.
Let our tailor wait upon you to adjust the shape and all
things necessary. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Gwillyn</span>.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> It's well we have got well clear of this humorous
exceptious gentleman; but I was in terrible pain lest he
should have observed your inclination to laugh.&mdash;But let
us not lose time, but go on to answer other persons.
[<i>Rings the bell.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Who waits without?</p>

<p><i>Servant.</i> Very many people, sir; but the lady with her
daughter says she has been here so often that she will be
next admitted.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> She will! she insists to see us altogether and
makes a difficulty even to show her daughter's face. Now
that is so preposterous and humourous, that I could not
answer her civilly and in general, and so put her off.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Let her come in, however, and have her answer
from us all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fennell</span>, <i>with her</i> <span class="smcap">Daughter</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Madam, what are your commands here?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Fen.</i> Gentlemen, I am a gentlewoman of a very
ancient family.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Very likely, madam; but, indeed, madam, we sit
here to provide for the stage, and not to hear pedigrees.
If you are of a house of yesterday, and please to-day&mdash;you'll
pardon me, madam&mdash;-that is what we are to mind
chiefly; but pray, madam, break into your business.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Fen.</i> Why, gentlemen, this young lady in a mask
with me is my daughter, and I propose her for the stage;
for I am reduced, and starve or beg we must not.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> But, madam, please to show us how your daughter
will help to keep us from wanting. Madam, we have a
great charge already.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Fen.</i> Why, you see, gentlemen, her height is very
well; she is neither tall nor short.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> We allow it, madam; but that is not all: she
must speak with a good air and grace.&mdash;Won't she unmask?
Must not we see more than thus much of her?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Fen.</i> No, no, gentlemen, we must come to some
manner of agreement before you see any further. To be
a maid of honour, a waiting lady on your Statiras and
Roxanas,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> or any of your theatrical princesses, she'll
deserve twenty shillings a week for mere dumb show&mdash;and
I'll have assurance of that in case you like her
face; or else it shan't be said she was offered to the
playhouse.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Well, but, madam, that is not all; for let her be
for dumb show only, her face is not all; she must be well
limbed [<i>They whisper and confer.</i>]&mdash;she may sometimes
be in a boy's dress&mdash;a Cupid, a young heir to a great
family, a page, or a gentleman-usher.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Fen.</i> Why, I was aware of the objection, and
have had a model taken of her legs, which you shall see,
gentlemen. There they are; as fine a straight leg and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
as proper a calf&mdash;you shall seldom see a woman's leg so
well made.&mdash;I don't question, gentlemen, but you have
seen great choice, gentlemen, in your posts; are well
acquainted with the symmetry of parts, and correspondence
of limbs.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Well, madam, you speak of your goods so advantageously,
and set them off so reasonably, that if the lady
pleases to show her face, we shall give twenty shillings
a week, certain.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Fen.</i> She is your servant, and shall constantly
attend rehearsals. [<span class="smcap">Daughter</span> <i>unmasks.</i></p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> On my word, a very surprising face.&mdash;Pray,
madam, may I beg the favour to see those pretty lips
move?</p>

<p><i>Daughter.</i> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Pray, madam, raise your voice a note higher.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Fen.</i> Gentlemen, I beg she may be kept wholly
for tragedy, for she takes prodigiously after me. She can
act only an haughty part; I was prodigiously haughty in
my youth. She will never act naturally anything but
what's cruel and unnatural, as the men call it.</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> But, madam, can't she repeat any verses, any
parts of a play? It's strange she should have an
inclination to the stage, and yet nothing by heart.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Fen.</i> Oh, I have inured her to get as many things
as possible to arm her against the wiles of men; as those
concerning Sir Charles Sedley&mdash;Say on, good Betty.</p>

<p>
<i>Daughter.</i> "Sedley has that prevailing gentle art,<br />
That can with a resistless charm impart<br />
The loosest wishes to the chastest heart."<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a><br />
</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> "The loosest wishes!"&mdash;I fancy somebody or
other has seen her legs otherwise than by a model&mdash;she
speaks so sensibly! [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Daughter.</i> "Raise such a conflict, kindle such a fire<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>Between declining virtue and desire,<br />
Till the poor vanquish'd maid dissolves away,<br />
In dreams all night, in sighs and tears all day."<br />
</p>

<p><i>Sev.</i> Well, madam, pluck up a spirit; and let us hear
you grace it, and do it with an air. Speak it politely,
with a side face; you are to imagine an audience though
there is none; and pray speak it with courage&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Sedley has that prevailing," &amp;c.</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Madam, you may be sure of all the encouragement
and care your beauty and merit deserve.
[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fennell</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Daughter</span>.</p>

<p>Well, now, let us look into some scenes that are under
examination, whether proper to be exhibited or not. Let
the scene of Mr. Buskin come on.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Trumpets sound, and drums beat a march.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Buskin</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Busk.</i> "In vain has conquest waited on my sword,<br />
In vain th' obedient waves have wafted o'er<br />
The bark in which I sailed; as if the gods<br />
Had ordered nature to preserve her course<br />
With gentle clime and season, to convey<br />
In safety me, their instrument of fate."<br />
</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Ho! brave, ho! brave. What's to come after
that?</p>

<p>
<i>Busk.</i> "All this was vain, since Clidiamira's eyes<br />
Have met with mine&mdash;and stopped my race of glory.<br />
Oh, Clidiamira&mdash;Oh! oh! oh! let all<br />
The elements break loose&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Ay, ay, to be sure, they can do no less, if
Clidiamira's really angry; but not so fast, not so fast, if
you please.</p>

<p><i>Busk.</i> Pray, sir, give me leave&mdash;Oh, Mr. Humber, is
it you? Your humble servant.&mdash;I submit&mdash;I know you
are a critic.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> To be free, sir, you must know this way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
blustering is a stage legerdemain; a trick upon the eyes
and ears of the audience. Look you, sir, this is a time
of licentiousness; and we must examine things, now we
are setting up to strip you, to know whether what you
say is good or not.</p>

<p><i>Busk.</i> How, strip me!</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Ay, strip you&mdash;for if it be not sense in your
doublet, it is not in your long robe. High heels on your
shoes, or the feathers on your beaver, cannot exalt you a
tittle. No; you must know, good folks, this is all a
cheat. Such stuff as this is only a tragedy of feathers&mdash;it
is only lace and ribbon in distress; undress the actor,
and the speech is spoiled.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Strip him&mdash;strip him!
[<i>They pull off his clothes.</i></p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Now speak, now speak.</p>

<p><i>Busk.</i> Give me my truncheon at least; I got it by heart
with a stick in my hand.</p>

<p><i>Many.</i> Ha, ha, ha; let him have his truncheon&mdash;let him
have his truncheon.</p>

<p><i>Busk.</i> Nay&mdash;pray, gentlemen and ladies, let me come
on the same board.&mdash;Nay&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> You shall do that.&mdash;Well, but begin.</p>

<p><i>Busk.</i> "In vain has conquest"&mdash;shan't I have a little
of the trumpet?</p>

<p><i>All.</i> No, no, no.</p>

<p><i>Busk.</i> Then the drum only?</p>

<p><i>All.</i> No, no.</p>

<p><i>Busk.</i> "Oh, Clidiamira&mdash;oh! oh! oh!"&mdash;It won't do;
one can't follow either love or honour without some
equipage.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> Well then, master, to keep you in countenance,
you shall take up your things, and in your doublet speak
that sentiment in the play called <i>The Patriot</i>,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> wherein<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
the great lord speaks to his friend, who applauds the
bestowing of his bounty. The friend, taking notice of
his conveying secretly relief to a distress'd person of
great merit, and thinking to please him, tells him that the
man obliged has found out who sent it, and said it was a
God-like action. To which the answer:<br />
"God-like indeed, could one bestow unseen!<br />
Thanks are too large returns, from soul to soul,<br />
For anything that we can handle thus:<br />
Heaven has no more for giving us our all.<br />
The means of sustenance man owes to man,<br />
As angels give each other thought for thought."<br />
Mr. Buskin, your most humble servant; mingle with
the company.&mdash;Take your things. Say that in a doublet,
cap, or waistcoat, with or without shoes, and make it little
if you can. [<i>The crowd takes in</i> <span class="smcap">Buskin</span>.</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> But I see you grow uneasy, to be diverted from
your main design; I'll only trouble you with two circumstances,
which to me appear very magnificent, tragical,
and great: the one is a great favourite in a court, a man
of consummate honour, who was surrounded with many
difficulties and enemies. They got the better of him so
far, as that he must be sacrificed unless he would open a
letter which came by an error into his hand, but was
directed to his enemy. He comes on in a soliloquy, but
chooses to preserve his honour and abstain from opening
it, and goes on to his ruin. He says but a word or two;
but let him come.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter a</i> <span class="smcap">Tragedian</span>, <i>with a letter in his hand.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Tragedian.</i> "Here is my fate: 'tis put into my hands;<br />
'Tis in my hands to take or to refuse;<br />
I cannot open it but with loss of honour&mdash;<br />
Be it for ever closed.<br />
I cannot escape death; that will come soon or late;<br />
'Tis in my power to make it find me innocent." [<i>Exit.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> You observe, Mr. Severn, here's no noise, no
eclat, no bustle, but simple and calm greatness.&mdash;The
next circumstance for which I beg your patience is that
of a great English general, who, observing the confederate
horse seized with a panic fear, and all, to a man, in the
utmost disorder, assumes himself and mounts an eminence,
and says he would stand there to revive the army.
He did so; the enemies soon observed so remarkable an
object, and cannonaded it. He stood the fury of their
cannon while the army marched&mdash;But he comes on.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Drums and trumpets to precede his march.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">General</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Gen.</i> "Nothing, but seeing me meet all they fear,<br />
Can avert the same contagion from the troops.<br />
Let them behold me die; or, what is more,<br />
Let them behold how I expect to die!" [<i>Exit.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>Hum.</i> It is allowable to help great thoughts, and
alarm the audience with warlike instruments, to give the
inattentive a sense of what is truly sublime. But I won't
detain you longer; let us go in; but as we are going off
a stage, let me repeat to you a couple of verses.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Would you reform an heedless guilty age,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Adorn with virtuous characters the stage.</span><br />

<h3>ACT THE FOURTH.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Pincers</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Barber</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Constable</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Pin.</i> How do you say, sir? All this is a
delusion! an imposition!</p>

<p><i>Barb.</i> Perfectly so, sir; no otherwise,
indeed, sir; and they have
seized Mr. Constable there, my neighbour,
who came into the house to
keep the peace, when they were
waging war in it.</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> What, lay hold upon a constable! detain the
constable! Do they know what they do?</p>

<p><i>Barb.</i> Ay, they know very well; but they don't care
what they do.</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> And was the ghost a cheat, and calling this an
inn all imposition?</p>

<p><i>Barb.</i> Yes, sir; but here Mr. Constable has found
below stairs an inlet into the house, and whence he can
let in all the people of Drury Lane and the parts
adjacent.</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> I have heard of Drury Lane in the country; but
they will do as well as any for this purpose.</p>

<p><i>Barb.</i> That is most excellent good luck; we will swing
them for false imprisonment, and that of so great an
officer as a constable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Constable.</i> But, sir, I want a warrant to do what I
would on this occasion.</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> There need none, sir; you have the law, which
will uphold you in it; the recovery of your liberty, and
my liberty, as well as that of the barber, will support
you. There is in your person the liberty of every man in
England. As you are a constable concerned, I am a
lawyer. I'll stand by you, I warrant you. But let's be
silent before you bring in the <i>posse</i>. Take these deeds
in your care and custody. [<i>Giving him deeds.</i>] Observe,
Mr. Barber, I deliver them to him; and now let us go, or
him go, and let in his people. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Constable</span>.] What
a prodigious villainy was here, Mr. Barber! I placed
such a confidence in this Mr. Severn, and took counsel
with him for the disposal of my niece, and thus he has
served me; but I have put my deeds relating to her into
the constable's hand; and if he can let his <i>posse</i> into the
house, I'll warrant you we will recover all.</p>

<p>[<i>A noise of people</i>:&mdash;"Beat down the doors; deliver
the lady."]</p>

<p><i>Barb.</i> Hark, hark! he has got them in, I warrant ye
the <i>posse</i> is raised; I'll warrant we shall have the whole
city and country on our side.</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> The whole matter is, how to conduct it legally.
Let me be but of the council, and we will knock them all
o' the head, and not transgress the law at all; we will
murder the dogs, I would say the rogues. Why, what is
there in it? they are no people, they are nobody in law;
and if they are no people, to kill them is to kill nobody;
for to fire at <i>fera natura</i>, creatures by nature wild&mdash;those
animals are lawful game, and any man that has so much
a year may kill them; so, Mr. Barber, any man may fire
upon these fellows; these stage-players, who are no persons,
have no right in themselves; and therefore any man
may kill them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

<p>[<i>A noise without</i>:&mdash;"Deliver the lady; give her to her
guardian; give her to her uncle."]</p>

<p><i>Barb.</i> They are just a-coming in; I know the neighbourhood
and the constable; you shall direct us all.</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> Nay, I'll warrant you all shall be safely and
legally done.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Enter a crowd of people.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Rabble.</i> Where is the gentleman? where is the gentleman?</p>

<p><i>Barb.</i> Here he is, gentlemen; and the players have
taken his niece from him; and, for aught we know, they
have ravished her; but, let it be so or no, we'll indict
them for it. Harkee, Mr. Pincers, will an indictment
for a rape lie in Drury Lane?</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> Lookee, gentlemen, we will fall upon them for
taking her and her clothes; and then afterwards come
upon them for the body, as we shall see cause; but we
must find this body before we can do anything.</p>

<p><i>Barb.</i> We will bear all down before us but we will find
her. Down with all their sham heavens, their counterfeit
seas; down with their false unsafe lands; down with
their windmills and their dragons; burn their barns; and
when we have got the lady, fire the house.&mdash;Come, follow
the gentleman.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Ay, ay.</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> Huzza, huzza!</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Huzza, huzza! [<i>Dog barks.</i></p>

<p><i>1st Rabble.</i> Don't mind their great dog; he barks a
sham. He is no true dog. Unkennel the dog within.
Harkee, neighbour, keep up your dogs&mdash;keep your dogs.
Halloo, halloo!</p>

<p><i>2nd Rabble.</i> Keep your dogs, gentlemen butchers;
keep the dogs to charge their house. I'll warrant we'll
spoil their battling, and rioting and fighting, and decoying
all our daughters and nieces to see sights, and never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
mind their business. Ho! the lady, the lady&mdash;we'll
have the lady.</p>

<p><i>Barb.</i> We'll make this young lady as famous as Helen
of Troy was. We'll burn all before us for her sake.
Come, let us hunt, let's see what's about this house in all
its parts&mdash;halloo, hunt.</p>

<p><i>Pin.</i> Let the constable march first; there's our safety,
that's our security.&mdash;Take notice, I declare before all
this company, it is in defence of this honest&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h3>(A FRAGMENT.)</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>


<p>The date of this fragment, which
Nichols named <i>The Gentleman</i>, is
uncertain; it was first printed in
1809, together with <i>The School for
Scandal</i>. The autograph MS. is in
the British Museum (Add. MS.
5145c). Steele had written of
high life below stairs in the <i>Spectator</i>
(No. 88), where he says that menservants "are
but in a lower degree what their masters themselves
are; and usually affect an imitation of their manners:
And you have in liveries, beaux, fops, and coxcombs,
in as high perfection as among people that
keep equipages. It is a common humour among the
retinue of people of quality when they are in their revels,
that is when they are out of their master's sight, to
assume in a humorous way the names and titles of those
whose liveries they wear." He then describes their
behaviour at an ordinary at Westminster, where he
"heard the maid come down and tell the landlady at the
bar that my Lord Bishop swore he would throw her out at
window if she did not bring up more mild beer, and that
my Lord Dick would have a double mug of purl." When
news arrived that the House of Lords was rising, "down
came all the company together, and away!" Servants
were wont to congregate at the entrance to Hyde Park,
while the gentry were at the Ring. "There are men of
wit in all conditions of life; and mixing with those people
at their diversions, I have heard coquets and prudes as
well rallied, and insolence and pride exposed (allowing
for their want of education), with as much humour and
good sense as in the politest companies." (See page <a href="#Page_281">281</a>.)</p>

<h3><i>THE GENTLEMAN.</i></h3>


<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Tom Dimple</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Harry Severn</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I'll serve you very faithfully in
this particular, since you have a
curiosity to pry into the affairs of
us poor servants.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> I think you are happier
than we masters. But how do you
contrive it, to be at a ball and masquerade
of your own, all the time we are at ours, and
yet be in readiness to attend when we break up or
want you?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Sir, we leave sentries at all the places where
you come out. All of us cannot expect to be at the
diversion every night; but the forty or fifty who are to
stay about the playhouse, or the person of quality's who
entertains, send frequent expresses to us. Besides, I own
to you, sir, that we find means to have tickets of our own,
and can send in among you, by the help of them, when we
please, and have warning enough of your motions. If we
are a little too tardy, the coachmen can, when they think
it convenient, make stops so as no one can stir, and keep
everything in a ferment till all troops are come together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> You put me in mind of a great many things
that have been till now unaccountable. Why, then, the
sudden motion when we have been all locked fast, tearing
and swearing, coachmen lashing, footmen bawling, and
link-boys offering help to call chairs or coaches, and
striving to lead or light you, is usually a hurry contrived
and made up on purpose; and the sudden getting loose
of one another, is only that the word is given, "all are
come," "all is right"!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> It is nothing else in the world.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> But, then, how do you do for your habits
and your music, and all the rest of the conveniences?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> You have been so good and kind a master, that
I'll hide nothing that may contribute to your diversion.
We are in fee with the wardrobe keepers at the playhouses;
and when the play is over, and all the parties
concerned are disposed of, as you are at your diversions,
the whole stock of clothes are in their hands; and they
let them out for so many hours, and pack [them] up again
with great order, and no harm done.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> Well, well, now there is no mystery; there
is nothing so easy, as all is safe without possibility of disappointment
or surprise.&mdash;But as to what is to be done
to-night&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> This alehouse, where we all meet, is joining to a
great house very well furnished; and the care of letting
it is committed to our landlord. He has broken down
a partition, which he can, in a day or two, make up again;
and we have noble apartments for our entertainments, not
inferior to those wherein our masters themselves are
received.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> You divert me extremely with this new scene
of pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> We shall be in our tip-top jollity to-night; all
the lower world [will] be together in as much
pleasure as ever the upper themselves enjoyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> What have you extraordinary at this time
more than any other?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Our landlord is giving up<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> his business, and
marries his daughter, Mrs. Jenny, my Lady Dainty's
chambermaid, to the favourite footman of Sir John
Plover, who is a great leader among us, and will keep
and increase the custom of the house. But the humour
is, no one is to know which is the bridegroom; for none
but the girl herself [knows] which of the company is
Sir John.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> How! Sir John?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I should have told you that we always call one
another by the names of our masters; and you must
not be surprised at hearing me answer to your honour's
to all who call to me; for, as I am a manager, and to be
barefaced, I cannot disguise that <i>I</i> am <i>you</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> It is no matter if they will take me as readily
for your fellow-servant.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> They'll never suspect you for my master.&mdash;But
here comes my landlord.</p>

<p><i>Landlord.</i> Come, Sir Harry, Sir Harry, 'tis past nine
o'clock; the company is coming&mdash;they have put all in
at the masquerade and the assemblies.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> [<i>Whispering</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Harry</span>.] As I am barefaced,
you can come to me when you please, when you are at a
loss.&mdash;But you see I must attend my charge.</p>

<p><i>Sir Har.</i> I beg your pardon; I'll interrupt you no
more; but if I like&mdash;you understand.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> You know my skill and diligence, my good
master; but adieu.&mdash;Landlord, you see the house fills;
let all the waiters be ready; pipes, tobacco, bread, cheese
and the like, for those who are in habits proper for such
coarse fare. What! none of the stewards ready but
myself?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter three others with wands, barefaced.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>2nd Steward.</i> Ay, ay, here we are&mdash;here we are.</p>

<p><i>3rd Steward.</i> We stayed only till we saw some quality
figures coming in.</p>

<p><i>2nd Steward.</i> Look you, how we are overrun with
nymphs and shepherds!&mdash;But look, look! there is some
sense in those stalking things, which move like pageants,
and are not of human shape.</p>

<p><i>1st Steward.</i> Right, they cannot be out in their parts&mdash;there
are no such things in nature&mdash;but patched-up
beings, out of mere fancy and imagination.</p>

<p><i>3rd Steward.</i> But have a care, ladies, shepherdesses,
nymphs; run, run&mdash;Here, here is a dragon that devours
virgins, as a pike does small fish.</p>

<p><i>2nd Steward.</i> Have a care&mdash;here he comes, here he
come&mdash;he eats all virgins without mercy, but will touch
nobody else.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Several women's voices together.</i></p>

<p>Let him come, let him come.</p>

<p><i>An old withered</i> <span class="smcap">Maid</span>, <i>crying out.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Old Maid.</i> Have a care, have a care, have a care; let
me get off, let me get off; oh me&mdash;oh me!
[<i>Running off.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Figure of St. George</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dicky</span>, <i>borne on a war-horse.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Dicky.</i> Fear not, fair one, fear not. I am St. George,
I'll save thee.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Dragon</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">St. George</span> <i>fight.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>The crowd cry out.</i> Ho-boy, St. George! Ho-boy,
dragon!&mdash;there's the knight of the world.</p>

<p><i>1st Masquer.</i> Hear, hear, the knight is going to speak.
As he's stout, he's merciful. He is going to give the
dragon his life&mdash;no, no, he's going to speak to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Constable.</i> Hold, hold, sir knight; the dragon's my
neighbour&mdash;he's a tailor in my neighbourhood.</p>

<p><i>2nd Masquer.</i> Open the dragon; open the dragon;
keep the peace; take out the tailor.</p>

<p><i>Lawyer Masquer.</i> Take care what you do; take care
what you do. If he is a denizen, the law is very severe.&mdash;Though
there are nine to make up a man, by a fiction
of law it is murder to kill any one of them: the law
supposes him a whole man.</p>

<p><i>1st Steward.</i> Ho! Mr. Fly-flap, Mr. Wardrobe-keeper,
give the company an account of the knight and
of his horse.</p>

<p><i>Wardrobe-keeper.</i> This is the poet's horse that trod
down all the persons who have been killed in tragedy
ever since I came to the house. The gentleman that
rides him has some verses about him, if he would
speak them.</p>

<p><i>Many Masquers.</i> Hear, hear!&mdash;Hear the verses!</p>

<p>
<i>St. George.</i> On this bold steed, with this dead-doing arm,<br />
Without art magic, help of draught or charm,<br />
Crowds have I slain, and routed from the field,<br />
Or made, as captives, to my mercy yield.<br />
My horse and me none could escape by flying,<br />
But saved their lives by well dissembled dying.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Cobbler Masquer.</i> Very well, very well, i'faith. Look
ye, look ye, gentlemen, I know the humour of that.
I live just by in Vinegar Yard, and I know the
humour of that. You must know he means by that&mdash;that
by pretending to be dead, the men whom the
valiant man in the play rides over, or cuts down, are
carried [off] safe and sound. Why, I have been called
in, when there has been a great battle in the house,
to help to carry off the dead; and I have brought a
man off dead over-night, and mended his shoes
next morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>

<p><i>4th Masquer.</i> Ho, brave Crispin!&mdash;that's a good jest,
i'faith.</p>

<p><i>Cobbler.</i> But my wife said a very good thing upon
that. "Look thee, Will," said she, for you must know
my name is William, "we shall never make anything of
this, if we are to wait for dead men's shoes."</p>

<p><i>4th Masquer.</i> Ho-boy, Crispin! Thou art a merry
rogue, Crispin!</p>

pounds and ten shillings the Residue of Neate and cleere
profitts to come to the Complt pursueant to the Agreement
aforesaid amounted to Ten pounds Eight shillings
and two pence and noe more as this Deft is informed
and beleives with which this deft beleives the Complt
was acquainted and that he was well contented and
satisfyed with the account given to him the Complt of
the Receipts and Charges of and for the said play called
the Tender Husband for the ffower ffirst dayes of acting
thereof And this Deft sayth that the profitt accrewing due

said second day of acting the said play wanted to make

Receipts on the third day of acting the said play called
the Tender Husband to be charged for the use of the
Company without chargeing any part thereof paid to the
Complaynant in regard the Complaynant refused to
receive the profitts due to him for that day But chose to
have a day in Winter in Leiu thereof as aforesaid And
this deft sayth that in pursueance of such Request made

putt up for the same to be acted the next day for the
Author's Benefitt; But a little before it was to have been
given out the Complt forbidd the same to be given out
on the Stage or putt into the Bills for his Benefitt saying
that he did not thinke there would be such an Audience
att it as would please him or used words to some such or
the like Effect But how ever the same play was acted on
the then next day and the whole Receipts that day being

three shillings and Six pence and noe more (as this deft
beleives &amp; is informed by the said Treasurer) which was
about two pounds seaventeen shillings more then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>

play was acted as aforesaid which two pounds seaventeen
shillings and Six pence this deft and the said principal
Actors were willing should be paid to the said Complt as
well as the summe of Ten pounds Eight shillings and two
pence before menconed And this deft sayth that as to the
Ten pounds Eight shillings and two pence which was
due to the Complt out of the Receipts of the said third
day according to the Agreement before menconed this
deft never received the same or any part thereof nor the
said two pounds seaventeen shillings and six pence But
both the said Summes remaine in the said Treasurers hands
for the use of the Complt as this deft beleives And this
deft gave order to the said M<sup>r</sup> Baggs the Treasurer to
pay the same to the Complaynant amounting together to
Thirteen pounds ffive shillings and Eight pence as this
deft computes the same And this deft beleives that M<sup>r</sup>
Baggs hath severall times offered to pay the same to the

<h4>STEELE <i>v.</i> WILBRAHAM, &amp;c., 1722.</h4>

<h5>(Page liii.)</h5>


<p>Steele's bill,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> after referring to the
Letters Patent of the 14th January 1714-15,
and to the agreement then made
by Steele with Wilks, Cibber, and
Booth, proceeds to state that in or
about 1713 Steele had contracted an
acquaintance with Edward Minshull,
Esq., of the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, who professed
great friendship, and offered to help Steele to
money to supply his then urgent occasions. The offer
being accepted, Minshull became bound with Steele to
one Cox for £500 or thereabouts, and to one Aston<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> for
£400 or thereabouts, and to some other persons, of whom
he borrowed, as he pretended, money to lend Steele; and
he lent Steele at several times some small sums, and
about the 24th July 1716 desired Steele to give him some
security for the money he had lent to and stood engaged
to pay for Steele, all which he then pretended to compute
at £1500 and more; and particularly he desired that a
security might be made to him of Steele's fifth part of
the Letters Patent and of the clothes, scenes, &amp;c., and
of the profits of the Theatre in Drury Lane; and Steele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
having a good opinion of Minshull's integrity, and believing
the account made out to be true, readily agreed to make
such security, whereupon Minshull got and prepared an
assignment of Steele's share to him, his executors and
assigns, dated the said 24th July 1716, the consideration
whereof was expressed to be the sum of £1500 paid to
Steele; but in truth there was not any sum then paid to
Steele, nor were the debts for which Minshull was bound
then paid, nor was any account then drawn out or settled
between Steele and Minshull. And at the same time
Minshull signed a defeasance to Steele, that upon payment
of the £1500 and interest at a day therein mentioned
the said assignment should be void; and Steele
thereupon directed Castleman, Treasurer of the Theatre,
to pay his share to Minshull or his order. And there
having been great dealings between Minshull and Charles
Gery, Esq., of London, of whom Minshull had at times
borrowed several sums on several securities, and Minshull
proposing to assign over the security from Steele, Gery
insisted that Steele should join in the assignment; but
Minshull declared there was no occasion for it, and that
Steele should make affidavit that he had no otherwise
encumbered his share in the Theatre; and Gery being
satisfied with this, Minshull told Steele that he was much
pressed for the payment of the debts to Cox and Aston,
and that he must raise money on Steele's assignment to
discharge those debts, and that for that purpose the
affidavit must be made, to which Steele consented. And
some time afterwards, as Steele had been lately informed,
Minshull assigned the security to Gery, but Steele could
not discover what money was paid by Gery. Minshull
endorsed Steele's note to Castleman, and gave it to Gery,
who received several sums from Castleman. Minshull
and Gery formed at that time a design to get Steele's
share of the scenes, clothes, and profits; and Minshull
undertook to purchase the same absolutely of Steele for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
£4000, which it was agreed between Minshull and Gery
should be for their joint and equal benefit; but the
£4000 was to be paid by Gery, and £2000 repaid by
Minshull as he could raise the same out of his moiety of
the profits; and this agreement was marked in the
assignment made by Minshull to Gery, or in some other
deed or writing between them. Minshull then often
requested Steele to sell his share, but being unsuccessful
he said he perceived Steele was in straits for money, and
that it would be proper for Steele to raise a considerable
sum at once, and professed that he would advance a
further sum of £2500 upon the security of the said
premises, and allow Steele two years for the payment
thereof. This Steele accepted, and Minshull being in
daily expectation, as he pretended, of receiving £3000,
or some such sum, directions were given by him to Mr.
Ralph Wilbraham, his attorney, to draw up an assignment
to him of Steele's share, which Wilbraham accordingly
got drawn up and engrossed. It was dated on
or about the 31st January 1716[-7], and was made
absolute, Minshull undertaking to give Steele a defeasance
thereof in payment of the said £4000 and interest
within two years of the date thereof. And this assignment
being drawn and engrossed, Minshull and Wilbraham
came to Steele, who was then attending the service of
his country in the House of Commons, and carried him
to the Horn Tavern, in the Palace Yard, Westminster,
and after the assignment was read over, Minshull, speaking
with Steele in another room, said that, being disappointed
of money, he could not pay Steele any part of
the said £2500, but would in a few days, and in the
meantime would give a note for the money, and that for
Steele's security the assignment should remain in Wilbraham's
hands till the sum was paid, and that he (Minshull)
would execute a proper defeasance to Steele. Steele,
being ignorant of matters of law, spoke to Wilbraham, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
assured him that he would receive no prejudice thereby,
adding that he (Wilbraham) was obliged to take extraordinary
care that Steele should not suffer because Steele put
such great confidence in him.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Steele was thus, at the
earnest request of Minshull and Wilbraham, induced to
sign the assignment of the 31st January 1717, and to sign
a receipt endorsed on the back of the paper for the sum
of £4000 as the consideration thereof; and Wilbraham
was a witness that Steele executed this assignment and
signed the receipt, well knowing that not one penny was
advanced as the consideration thereof, and that the
same was only to be security for the £1500 for which
the former assignment was given, and the £2500 when
the same should be paid to Steele, and for which Minshull
then gave Steele a receipt, Wilbraham being a
witness; and Wilbraham assured Steele that this receipt
would screen him from any prejudice by signing the
receipt for £4000, and that if the £2500 were not paid
to Steele, by virtue of the said receipt for £2500, Steele
would be entitled to an allowance thereof out of the
£4000. By agreement between Steele and Minshull
the assignment of the 31st January 1717 was then
deposited in the hands of Wilbraham as a common
trustee between them, until the £2500 should be paid
to Steele and a proper defeasance executed by Minshull;
and until that was done no use was to be made of the
assignment, and then Steele's former assignment for £1500
was also to be delivered up to him. And Steele requiring
some further memorandum from Wilbraham of such trust,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
Wilbraham wrote a short memorandum, acknowledging
that he had received the indenture of the 31st January,
purporting a sale from Steele to Minshull of the fifth part
of the Letters Patent, scenes, clothes, &amp;c., and profits in
consideration of £4000, which Deed was deposited in
his hands in order that in case Steele, his executors, &amp;c.,
should redeem the same within two years, the same
should be delivered up to be cancelled and destroyed;
and this he promised to do, unless the Deed were lost by
fire or other unavoidable accident. Wilbraham and
Minshull witnessed this memorandum by affixing their
signatures; and Steele depended upon Minshull's Note,
and Wilbraham's memorandum, and Wilbraham's privity
to and knowledge of the whole affair, and the Deed being
kept by Wilbraham, so that there should be no prejudice
to Steele, that the £2500 would have been paid, and the
former assignment delivered up; and he therefore then
delivered his counterpart and defeasance thereof to
Minshull. And Minshull, or Gery at his order, continued
by virtue of the first assignment of July 1716 to receive
Steele's fifth part of the profits; but Minshull never paid
Steele the £2500, to the very great disappointment of
Steele, who, depending upon the same, was reduced to
great straits, and therefore desired Minshull would supply
him with some part of it; this Minshull agreed to do if
Steele would consent that the agreement in Wilbraham's
hands should remain as security for such further sums as
Minshull should advance beyond the £1500 for which
the first security was given. Steele consented, being
desirous that whatever money was really advanced to
him should be repaid with interest; and thereupon Minshull
supplied several sums and paid several sums for
Steele; and Gery received out of Steele's share of the
profits £2398 16s. 10d., or some such sum; and Steele's
share was received by Minshull, or his order, Gery, for
the years 1716 and 1717, to the amount of £1418.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
Having paid to Minshull by one Mr. Paterson £400,
Steele desired Minshull, on or about the 22nd October,
to state accounts with him, which Minshull did, and notwithstanding
the debt of Aston was included in the first
security for £1500, yet Minshull charged Steele with the
sum of £47 8s. for the costs thereof, and also with
several sums over and above the £1500, the total of one
account amounting to £768 19s. 9d., and the total of
the other to £712 5s. 10d., so that on the whole Minshull
charged Steele as debtor for £3029 3s. 7d., and at
the same time gave Steele credit for £1418 received of
Castleman and £400 received of Paterson, whereby
there was a balance of £1211 3s. 7d. due from Steele to
Minshull, as will appear by the said account signed by
Minshull and Steele; and Gery was privy to the stating
of this account, and continued by virtue of Steele's note
endorsed by Minshull to receive Steele's share of the
profits until the 24th January 1719, and received thereby
£348. There remained then due to Minshull for principal
and interest only £886 16s. 6d. or thereabouts, but
Steele tendered to Minshull £900, and demanded the
assignment for £4000, and also the assignment for £1500,
which Minshull pretended he had long before redeemed,
and often promised to deliver to Steele, and had received
back the defeasance and counterpart from Steele, and
also Steele's note to Castleman. Minshull sent to Wilbraham's
house for the said assignment, but Wilbraham
being out of town or from home, Minshull desired the
matter might be put off to another opportunity, and that
in the meantime he might continue to receive the profits
belonging to Steele, the same to be afterwards deducted
out of the said £886 16s. 6d. To this Steele agreed;
and on the 4th February 1719 paid Minshull the further
sum of £300. And afterwards, on or about the 26th
November 1719, Gery, by virtue of Steele's note, received
the further sum of £238; but Minshull had in the meantime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
paid to and for Steele some other sums, so that, on
the 11th December 1719, there remained due from Steele
to Minshull £596 2s. 9d.; and thereupon Minshull by a
writing dated the said 11th December declared that
Steele before the expiration of two years from the 31st
January 1717 tendered to him full satisfaction for the
consideration money mentioned to be advanced to Steele
by the said deed of sale, but that he (Minshull) could not
then come at the deed by reason of Wilbraham not being
at home when he sent for it, and therefore he desired
Wilbraham by this writing to deliver up to Steele or his
order the deed dated 31st January 1717 on payment of
the sum of £596 2s. 9d., that being all the money then
due to Minshull. Steele sent this writing to Wilbraham,
offering to pay the £596 2s. 9d., and well hoped the
deed would have been delivered up to him, and that the
other assignment of the 24th July 1716, and the order to
Castleman, would have been delivered up by Minshull.
But now Minshull, Wilbraham, and Gery, combining together,
and with William Woolley, Esq., of the county of
Derby, and with others as yet unknown, to defraud Steele
of his share in the Theatre, Wilbraham utterly refused to
deliver up the deed of assignment of the 31st January
1717, but threatened to deliver it to Gery, with whom
he entered into an agreement for that purpose; and Gery
insisted that there was due to him from Steele £2500 or
some such great sum, and that Steele's fifth share ought
to be charged therewith; and to cover these unjust proceedings
he pretended that he advanced £1500 to
Minshull upon Minshull assigning over to him Steele's
security of the 24th July 1716, and that on the 31st
January 1717 he advanced to Minshull the further sum
of £2500, and that Minshull paid the same to Steele;
and that by a deed poll dated on or about the 31st
January 1717, Minshull declared that the £4000 mentioned
to be the consideration money of the said deed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
sale of that date was the proper money of Gery, Minshull's
name being used only in trust for Gery; and by
means of this pretended deed poll of trust Minshull and
Gery endeavoured to charge Steele with the whole
£4000, although for £1500, part thereof, they or one of
them had a former assignment, which was never delivered
up, and no part of the residue, £2500, was paid until
long after, and then only some part thereof in small
sums, and, as Steele had reason to believe, raised out of
the very share of the profits belonging to him; and in
truth no such sum of £2500 was advanced by Gery at
that time upon the said security, nor was the said declaration
of trust executed till long afterwards, when there
were various accounts between Minshull and Gery, and
Gery was apprehensive that he should lose money by
Minshull; nor did Gery till lately inform Steele of the
said declaration of trust, and Steele apprehended he had
nothing to do with any person but Minshull, as Minshull
often informed him; and he looked upon Gery only as
the order of Minshull, and accountable to Minshull for
what he received; nor did Gery ever oppose or forbid
Steele paying money to Minshull. And if any such trust
were fairly declared for Gery, yet he ought only to stand
in the place of Minshull as to what was due to Minshull
on the 31st January 1717, and which he long since
received with interest and a great overplus; and Wilbraham,
in whose custody the assignment for £4000 was
left, ought to have acquainted Gery that no part of the
£4000 was advanced except the £1500 secured by
Steele for the assignment; or at least Gery would have
received such information if he had inquired of Wilbraham
or Steele. And at other times Gery pretended he
had assigned his interest in the premises to Woolley, and
would not concern himself about the same, although he
well knew that since the 11th December 1719, he had
received of Castleman at several times the further sum of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
£394, so that upon a fair account there now remained
due from Steele to Minshull or his order only about
£220, which sum Steele was willing to pay to Minshull
or Gery or Woolley, as the Court should ordain, upon the
cancelling of the several securities entered into by Steele
to Minshull. But Minshull, Gery, and Woolley most unreasonably
insisted upon charging Steele with the whole
£4000 and interest from the 31st January, 1717, and
nevertheless refused to discover when or how this
£4000 was advanced or paid by Gery to Minshull, or
what they knew or had been informed, or what interest
Woolley had therein. All which being contrary to
equity, Steele prayed that writs of subpœna might be
directed to Minshull, Gery, Wilbraham, and Woolley,
commanding them to answer the matters contained in
this Bill.</p>

<p>Wilbraham's answer, dated 17th March 1721[-2], is
the only one existing. It states that some short time
before the 31st January 1717 Minshull gave Wilbraham
directions for preparing such assignment or sale from
Steele to Minshull of Steele's fifth part in the Theatre, as
was mentioned in Steele's Bill, and two parts of such
assignment were engrossed, leaving a blank for the consideration
money; and Wilbraham said that to the best
of his remembrance he carried the engrossments to
Steele's then house in St. James's Street, and not to the
Horn Tavern; and Wilbraham read over the assignment,
and then Steele and Minshull retired to another room, as
he apprehended to converse together upon the subject-matter
of the assignment. When they returned, a proposal
was made by one or both of them, that inasmuch as
the assignment was drawn absolute and without any
clause of redemption, and yet it was intended to be
redeemable and to be only in the nature of a mortgage,
the assignment, when executed by Steele, should be deposited
in Wilbraham's hands as a common trustee, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
that he should give to Minshull a note that the deed was
in his custody, and that he would deliver it up to Steele
upon Steele's redeeming the same within two years' time
from the date of the deed. Steele particularly asked
Wilbraham whether, in case the deed was deposited in
his hands, the note would be sufficient to make the deed
a mortgage, and Wilbraham said that it would, if the note
were attested and witnessed by Minshull. Steele then
acquiesced in the proposal, and did not in Wilbraham's
hearing require any other defeasance of the deed; and
Wilbraham was ordered to fill up the blank, and make
the consideration £4000. The engrossed copies were
then signed, and Steele gave a receipt for £4000, which
was endorsed on the deed executed by him, and Wilbraham
added his signature as witness. The deed was then
handed to Wilbraham, who gave a receipt&mdash;as mentioned
in Steele's Bill&mdash;which was attested by Minshull. Wilbraham
was of opinion that Steele, like himself, then
believed Minshull to be a man of substance. Wilbraham
did not remember to have seen any money paid by
Minshull to Steele, but believed Minshull gave Steele a
note or receipt for £2500, for which sum Minshull promised
to be accountable to Steele, and Wilbraham believed
he added his signature as witness. Wilbraham
denied that he assured Steele that this note or receipt
would effectually secure him from any prejudice which
might arise to him by his signing the receipt for £4000,
or that he told Steele that if the £2500 were not paid
him he would, by virtue of the note or receipt for £2500,
be entitled to an allowance thereof out of the £4000, or
that Steele asked him any questions relating thereto. He
also denied that the deed was placed in his hands as a
common trustee until the £2500 should be paid to Steele
and a proper defeasance executed, or that until the same
was done no use was to be made of the deed, or that
then Steele's former assignment for £1500 was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
delivered up to Steele; and he also denied that the deed
was given to him upon any other terms than those set
forth in the note which he gave; nor did he use any persuasion
to induce Steele or Minshull to entrust the deed
to him, or to induce Steele to sign the deed or the receipt
thereon endorsed, or to accept Minshull's note or receipt
for £2500; nor was he any way privy to or acquainted
with the reasons which induced Steele to do the same,
save that he knew the £1500 was or was mentioned to
be the consideration of a former deed of sale of Steele's
fifth share, dated about 24th July 1716. And Wilbraham
had heard that Gery had, before the 31st January 1717,
advanced £1500 to Minshull upon the credit of Steele's
first assignment, and that Minshull had assigned over to
Gery Steele's first assignment as security; but he did not
then apprehend that Gery had advanced to Minshull, or
was to advance, £2500, and therefore he understood
himself to be only a trustee as between Steele and Minshull.
But some time afterwards Minshull and Gery came
to Wilbraham and told him that Gery had advanced a
further sum of £2500, and that the whole £4000 was
therefore, in truth, Gery's money. Wilbraham then drew
up a declaration of trust to that effect, dated 31st
January 1717, which was duly executed by Minshull in
the presence of one Mr. William Aspin and Wilbraham,
witnesses. But Wilbraham admitted that this deed was
not executed on the 31st January 1717, as dated, but
some time afterwards, though he could not remember the
particular time. After the execution of this last deed
Wilbraham considered himself as a common trustee
between Steele and Gery. After all this, when, as Wilbraham
believed, Minshull had failed in answering
Steele's drafts of money upon him, Steele sent to Wilbraham
and offered him thirty guineas to deliver up the
deed of assignment of the 31st January, and said Minshull
was consenting thereto; but Wilbraham answered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
Minshull's consent would not indemnify him for so doing,
because he knew that the money intended to be secured
by the assignment was not then Minshull's but Gery's,
and that he must have Gery's consent; he therefore
refused to deliver up the deed. And he believed Minshull
sent to him when he was not at home, as narrated
in Steele's Bill; and he from time to time acquainted
Gery with the proceedings of Steele and Minshull; but
he denied that he had threatened to give the deed to
Gery, or had entered into any engagement with Gery for
that purpose. The deed was still in his hands or power.
He was never taken into council by Steele and Minshull,
except that he paid, subsequently to the assignment of
the 31st January 1717, £70 to Hugh Reason, Esq.,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> for
Steele by order of, and with the money of, Minshull,
and had also seen several notes which Steele drew on
Minshull, which he believed were paid by Minshull.</p>

<p>There is no record of this case having ever come
before the Court, and there are no answers to Steele's
Bill from Minshull, Gery, or Woolley. Fresh arrangements
were entered into in 1723, as will be seen below.</p>

<p>In their bill, dated 4th September 1725,
the complainants,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> after describing the
Indenture Quadrupartite of June 3,
1724,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> the Articles of Agreement of September,
1721,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> the Indenture between
Steele and Woolley of June 17, 1723,
and the note to Castleman of July 17,
1723,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> said that they well hoped they should have had the
benefit of the assignment and letter of attorney to Scurlock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
for the payment of Steele's debts and incumbrances,
and that Wilks, Cibber, and Booth would have ordered
the treasurer of the theatre to have paid and duly
accounted with Scurlock weekly, and for all arrears due
to Steele at the time of the assignment, as in all justice
and equity they ought to have done, the rather because
Woolley had been long since paid the £900 due to him,
together with all interest thereupon. But Wilks, Cibber,
and Booth, confederating together with Castleman, their
treasurer, and with Woolley and others, to defraud the
complainants of their just right, and to elude the force of
the assignment made by Steele for the benefit of his
creditors, refused to come to any account with the complainants
touching the profits, pretending that the charges
they had been put to in finding clothes, scenes, &amp;c., had
been so great that they had made little or no clear profit,
and yet they at the same time refused to disclose their
expenses; and at other times they pretended that Steele
by himself or his agents had from time to time received
his full share of the profits; whereas the complainants
expressly charged that the profits, over and above all
expenses, had been very great, and that neither Steele
nor any person acting by his order had received any but
a very small and inconsiderable part of his share of the
profits since the time of his entering into partnership
with Wilks, Cibber, and Booth, and that there was now a
very great sum owing to him. And at other times the
defendants, and especially Woolley, pretended that the
£900 secured for Woolley was not yet paid, and that
until that was paid the provisions for the other creditors
could not and ought not to take place; but the complainants
expressly charged that this £900 was and
ought long since to have been paid out of the profits of
the fourth part belonging to Steele; and Woolley and the
others refused to inform Steele how much had been paid
to Woolley. And at other times Wilks, Cibber, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
Booth pretended that they, on the 24th January
1719[-20], were, together with Steele, suspended by the
Lord Chamberlain from further acting, and that from the
time of this suspension (whatever licence they afterwards
obtained for proceeding therein), they were not answerable
to Steele for any part of the profits; whereas Steele
expressly charged that the suspension lasted only two
days or thereabouts, neither could the Lord Chamberlain
or any other person thereby or otherwise except by due
course of law deprive him of his share of the profits,
wherein he had a just freehold during his life by the
Grant and Letters Patent from His Majesty; and therefore
Wilks, Cibber and Booth ought to pay and be
accountable to him for his just share as if no such suspension
had been. And at other times the defendants pretended
that by some provision in the aforesaid Articles of
Agreement it was provided that neither of the parties
thereto should at any time sell, mortgage, part with or
incumber his or their share without the consent in writing
of the rest of the said parties, and it was pretended that
Wilks, Cibber, and Booth never gave such assent to the
assignment made by Steele to Scurlock; whereas Steele
and Scurlock declared that Wilks, Cibber, and Booth
were well aware of the assignment before it was made,
and had copies of it delivered to them severally afterwards,
and although they did not give their consent in
writing, yet they did not oppose or forbid the same; and
if they had, yet the same being for the payment of Steele's
creditors, it ought to be supported and made good by
the Honourable Court, or at least it could not debar
Steele from having an account of his share of the profits.
Yet upon these and the like pretences the defendants not
only refused to pay Scurlock, on behalf of Steele's
creditors, but likewise refused to come to an account with
Steele. Sometimes they pretended that they were
entitled to a dividend of £10 a piece each week, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
some such considerable sum, out of the profits, in consideration
of their extraordinary trouble in the management
of the theatre and their playing their several parts,
previous to and exclusive of the dividend to be made
under the Articles between them and Steele, and they had
accordingly ever since the date of the said Articles appropriated
these sums, regardless of Steele's share or interest.
And they pretended to be entitled to the whole of the
money given by His Majesty or any of the Royal Family
when they were graciously pleased to be present at any
performances, and they had kept such moneys; whereas
the complainants declared that Steele had a right to his
share of all profits whatsoever. And the defendants
pretended that they had a right to, and had set aside for
their own use, £20 a night or some greater sum under
the name of several constant charges, contingencies, and
bills, and pretended that Steele had no right to share
therein; and Steele charged that in favour of Mrs. Oldfield,
Mrs. Porter, and Mrs. Booth, three of the actresses
at Drury Lane, on their respective benefit nights the
defendants had forborne to deduct the necessary expenses
of the house out of the profits of the night, as they ought
to have done, but had placed the same to the account of
the partnership, whereby Steele had been charged a fourth
part of those expenses without any profit whatever; and
on the benefit nights allowed to under-officers and others
of the theatre, they had deducted each night, which
they had shared and divided, without admitting Steele to
any share. And sometimes the defendants pretended
that Steele had no colour to call them to account touching
any of these deductions or allowances to themselves,
because he had from time to time passed and allowed
these accounts without objection, and agreed to the said
deductions, &amp;c.; but this he never did; if he had passed
accounts without objection, it was through want of knowledge
or oversight. And Wilks, Cibber, and Booth had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
in other ways defrauded Steele; it was therefore prayed
that writs of subpœna be issued to compel them,
together with Castleman and Woolley, to answer these
premises.</p>

<p>The "joint and several answers" of Wilks, Cibber,
Booth, and Castleman are dated October 13, 1725. Long
before the Letters Patent to Steele, Wilks, Cibber, and
Booth had, as they said, a licence to act at Drury Lane,
and were acting there at the Queen's death, and had
scenes, &amp;c., there of great value; and a short time after
the Queen's death, they, looking upon Steele as a person
who had a great acquaintance, and who was fit and able
to promote the interest of the theatre, did, for these
reasons, and out of friendship and kindness to Steele,
invite him to come into a share and benefit of the theatre,
for which he seemed very thankful; and it was agreed he
should apply for a new licence, which he obtained, and
which was afterwards, by agreement with them, changed
for a Patent. The application for the Patent was to be
in Steele's name only, but upon the express trust that
Wilks, Cibber, and Booth should have an equal share in
it; and when Steele applied, he informed these defendants
that he could not obtain a reference to the Attorney and
Solicitor-General for having such a Patent without first
having their consent, as they shared with him in the
licence; and they thereupon gave their written consent
to Steele, to whom a Patent was then granted. And
some time afterwards Steele agreed to give them £1200
as a consideration for the fourth part of the scenes, clothes,
&amp;c., belonging to them, and did pay to each of them
£400, as appears from the receipts. Then came the
Articles Quadrupartite of September 1721. By acting
under the Letters Patent the defendants had received
large sums, which had been entered in books and kept
by Richard Castleman, their treasurer and cashier.
Divers sums had been paid to great numbers of persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
weekly and otherwise, as they were entitled to receive
the same; and the accounts had been at sundry times
stated and settled by the defendants and Steele, and
Steele had received his share; on the 18th June 1723, in
particular, he gave his receipt as follows: "Received of
Richard Castleman £708 8s. 2d., being so much due to
me arising from the profits of the Theatre Royal in Drury
Lane, I say received in full to this day, <span class="smcap">Richard Steele</span>."
This was a stated account, and ought not to be ravelled
into. From June 18, 1723, to June 25, 1725, divers
other considerable sums had been received and paid on
account of the theatre; and Steele, or persons lawfully
authorised by him, had received his share thereof. On
June 25, 1725, Richard Eadnell received of Castleman,
by virtue of a letter of attorney executed to him by Steele,
£52 10s. 3d., as Eadnell's receipt showed: "I say
received for Sir Richard Steel's use ballance due for the
year 1725, £471 13s. 2d., being a fourth part of the clear
profits," &amp;c.; and these defendants acknowledged that
they had each of them received to their own use from the
18th June, 1723, £1 13s. 4d. for every day upon which
a play had been acted, exclusive of Steele. This they
claimed as a consideration for their acting and the extraordinary
charge they were put to in respect thereof, for
which they had no allowance in the said accounts; and
they said that Steele never made any objection to the
same to their knowledge till the filing of this bill. There
had been from time to time paid to other actors more
than £1 13s. 4d. a day for acting. On the 18th June
last the defendants left off acting under the Letters
Patent, and so discontinued until the 4th September last,
during which interval no profits did or could arise; and
since the 4th September they had acted seventeen nights
and no more up to the time of putting in this answer, and
the clear profits of those seventeen nights could not at
present be set forth, because tradesmen's bills were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
sent in; but as soon as they could the defendants were
ready to account for the same and to share all just allowances.
They denied that they had deducted or claimed
£10 a week for management or acting, or any sum other
than as above mentioned, nor had they set apart or
divided among themselves £20 a night or other sum on
pretence of incidental charges, &amp;c., exclusive of Steele,
nor had they taken to their own use, exclusive of Steele,
any part of such bounty money as His Majesty or any
members of the Royal Family had given. And they said
that Mrs. Oldfield, Mrs. Porter, and Mr. Mills had plays
once in every year acted for their respective benefit,
without any sums being deducted for the charge of the
house, which was the best agreement the defendants
could make with them; no other actors had the like
privilege of having benefit plays without deduction for
the charges of the house; and these defendants denied
that they had had any benefit thereby, exclusive of
Steele. And they said that, finding by long experience
that the profits grew less towards the end of the spring
and until June or July, the time of leaving off acting, £5
for every acting night was and had been kept back in
order to make up the charges of the house in case the
money received should not be sufficient for that purpose,&mdash;which
often happened about the latter end of the
season; but when they left off acting the said sum of £5
was always brought to account, and what remained after
the charges were paid was divided among these defendants
and Steele equally. And these defendants said that
they had great ground to expect that Steele would not,
contrary to his own express agreement with them in
writing, have sold, parted with, or encumbered his property
in the Patent, clothes, scenes, and profits to any
one without the defendants' consent in writing, especially
because that to accommodate Steele and at his particular
request (he being indebted to Edward Minshull, Esq., in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
the sum of £200, by whom the debt was assigned to
Mr. Gery, and by him to Mr. Woolley) these defendants
consented and agreed with Steele and Woolley that
Castleman should pay to Woolley £200 a year out of
Steele's share till the debt, with interest, should be paid.
There was now £500 of the debt unpaid, and no interest
had been paid. By Articles Quadrupartite, dated 19th
September 1721,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> between Steele, Wilks, Cibber, and
Booth, reciting the aforesaid Articles, and also that the
then Lord Chamberlain did some time since by his order
direct that Steele should not be paid his fourth part,
Steele did, for himself, his executors, &amp;c., agree that if
at any time the King, Lord Chamberlain, or other person
authorised by the King should order that Steele be not
paid his share, but should direct that Steele's share
should be paid to any other person, that Steele's share
should cease to be paid to him, and he should be debarred
from demanding his share during the continuance
of such order; and so with any proportion of Steele's
share. Steele had some time since been suspended, but
the defendants denied that they ever took advantage
thereof. They were strangers to the several demands
made by persons named in the complainants' bill as
creditors of Steele, and conceived they were in nowise
concerned therein. Castleman denied that he refused to
let Steele see the books.</p>

<p>Richard Eadnell, of the Inner Temple, Gent., solicitor
to Steele and Scurlock, made oath on the 27th October,
that on Wednesday the 20th October he applied to
Castleman, treasurer at the old playhouse in Drury Lane,
on behalf of the complainants, and told him that he had
occasion to look in the books of accounts kept for Steele
and the defendants, and that he, the deponent, would
wait on Castleman for that purpose when convenient.
But Castleman said he could show no books or give any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
information without an order to do so from the other
defendants. And on the 21st Eadnell applied to Wilks,
Cibber, and Booth, but they utterly refused to give an order
to Castleman, saying that no one should inspect the books
or papers save Steele himself. Notice was subsequently
given to the defendants' solicitor that the Court would be
asked to make an order that these books could be examined
by Steele or his solicitor;<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> and the order was
duly granted. On the 2nd February 1726 Eadnell made
oath that by virtue of this order he had looked over the
books, and by them it appeared that Wilks, Cibber, and
Booth had each received of Castleman £480 10s. (<i>sic</i>)
for clear profits from the beginning of that season till
Saturday, 15th January last, and Castleman had received
the like sum of £487 10s. for the use of Steele, out of which
he had paid £200 to Woolley, as arranged; but Castleman
refused to pay Eadnell the remaining £287 10s. without
the consent of Wilks, Cibber, and Booth. Eadnell thereupon
applied to them, and gave them a copy of a letter of
attorney duly executed by Steele and Scurlock, empowering
him to receive and give discharges for such money as
should become due to them from the theatre; but Wilks,
Cibber, and Booth absolutely refused to direct Castleman
to pay Eadnell, unless Eadnell would give them discharges
for £30 which they received weekly on pretence
of acting exclusive of Steele, and which was now in dispute
in that Court. Wilks, Cibber, and Booth had
received this £10 apiece weekly over and above the
£487 10s. since the commencement of the winter season,
and still intended to receive the same, as they informed
Eadnell, notwithstanding the same was in dispute. And
it appeared that over and above the £487 10s. and the
£30 weekly, the sum of £30 a week was kept in the
hands of the treasurer under the name of contingencies,
in case there should be occasion to advance any money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
at any time on account of any new performances or otherwise.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>The defendants having put in their answer, Steele's
counsel obtained leave, on the 12th February, to amend
the complainants' bill.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> The answer of Wilks, Cibber,
and Booth to this amended bill is dated 15th June 1726.
The defendants said they never refused to disclose to
Steele the expenses incurred for scenes, clothes, &amp;c.;
those charges were entered in books which Steele could
examine, and which they had reason to believe he had
often inspected. In accordance with the order of the
Court of the 28th October last, Eadnell had often examined
the books, and was never denied the same. They
submitted, therefore, whether they need do more than
refer to the books as regards the particular sums laid out
in clothes, scenes, &amp;c. They never denied that Steele
might controvert the accounts, but they apprehended he
had no reason to do so, for the allowances they demanded
were reasonable, and were for the daily and
extraordinary labour and expenses in acting their several
parts not otherwise charged for. If they had not taken
upon themselves to look after and manage the theatre,
they and Steele, instead of being gainers, would have
lost by it; and if Steele had been as active on his part
in the management as they (which he ought to have
been by their Agreement), the same would have been an
addition to the clear profits of the theatre, at least one
fourth part.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Wilks, Cibber, and Booth had commenced
a cross action against Steele.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> In their bill,
dated 11th January 1725-26, they said that Swiney and
Collier had both constantly attended the business of the
theatre, and much benefit had resulted therefrom; Collier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
solicited persons of quality, and drew audiences to the
theatre. When Steele was invited to come into partnership,
he faithfully promised to attend the meetings and
consultations of the Company, and to write plays and
other performances, and to use his utmost endeavour to
support the interest thereof; and he did continue to
attend the business of the Company until 28th January
1719-20, since when he had altogether absented himself.
From that date they had each taken to their own use
£1 13s. 4d. a day, and Steele was so conscious that they
deserved a much greater sum that he allowed the accounts
wherein the same was charged. The scope of this cross
bill, therefore, was that Wilks, Cibber, and Booth might
be quieted in receiving the said £1 13s. 4d. apiece
exclusive of Steele, and might have such allowance as
the Court should think reasonable for the expense they
were at in clothes, periwigs, laces, and linen, and for
their trouble in instructing the actors and overseeing
artificers, &amp;c., and might be indemnified in paying the
£1200 and interest to Woolley, and be relieved.</p>

<p>Steele's answer to this bill was taken by commission
by Alexander and Theophilus Scurlock on June 23, 1726.
He denied that on entering into the partnership he promised
to attend meetings or instruct young actors, not
being qualified or required to appear as an actor; but he
believed he did in general promise to write plays, and to
promote the interests of the theatre, and this he had
done to the utmost of his power, as the managers had
often admitted; see, for example, Cibber's dedication to
him of <i>Ximena. The Conscious Lovers</i> "brought more
money to the House than any play was ever known to
do;" and he was at that time preparing, as fast as his
health would permit, a new Comedy, which, God willing,
he hoped to finish by the next season, the plot of which
play was formed for the reformation of the theatre, and
restoring the credit and good sense of theatrical entertainments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
which he was sadly sensible was never more
wanted. He had done and was doing as much as his
health would permit. He had entered into an agreement
on the 4th September 1721, and then or shortly before,
when accounting for his share during the time of the
pretended suspension by the Lord Chamberlain, the other
managers had urged that they had lost much in 1720 in
connection with the South Sea scheme, and that Steele
had not borne his share of the cost of scenes; and he
then, out of pure friendship and good-will, forgave them
£1,200, which he believed was due to him. Steele insisted
that he was not obliged to make Wilks, Cibber,
and Booth any allowance for their managing and acting,
as they were by the Articles obliged to do their duty in
consideration of the three fourth parts they received;
but he denied that he had pretended they ought not to
be allowed for clothes, &amp;c., used on the stage, he being
willing to allow his share out of the joint stock; and he
believed they had frequently taken out of the joint stock
for their own private clothes, which they brought to
the joint account; all which Steele allowed without objection.
He admitted he asked permission to assign his
share, and, being refused, assigned his interest without
such consent to Scurlock, and he hoped that what he did
through the need of satisfying his creditors would not in
equity be a breach of his covenant. He did not know of
the deduction of £1 13s. 4d. a day till the beginning of
1724[-5], when he brought his bill to be relieved against
it; and he hoped that notwithstanding his signing the
receipt of the 18th June 1723, he should be at liberty
to call the managers to an account touching the said deduction.</p>

<p>The original cause was before the Court several times
in August and October 1726.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Leave was given to
Wilks, Cibber, and Booth to examine Castleman, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
material witness for their case, and in no way concerned
in point of interest in the matters in question; and upon
application that Castleman should pay Steele £468 4s.,
which was found to be his share of the clear profits for
1725, it was ordered, by consent, that Castleman should
pay Steele £200, subject to the order which should be
made upon the hearing of the cause. In December leave
was given to Steele and Scurlock to examine Castleman
as a witness for them. The "answer of William Woolley,
Esqre., one of the Defendants to the Bill of Complaint"
of Steele and Scurlock, was not put in until the 20th
October 1726.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> It contains nothing fresh of importance.
Woolley said he had received £600 of the £900 due to
him from Steele, and that £300 was still due, besides
interest; and he urged that he was entitled to his £200
a year in preference to all other creditors mentioned in
Steele's bill. On the 21st November, Wilks, Cibber, and
Booth obtained leave to amend their bill in the case in
which they were complainants; and Alexander and
Theophilus Scurlock were again commissioned to take
Steele's answer.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> In this answer to the amended bill,
which was not sworn until the 11th May 1727, Steele
said it was true that he had declared that Cibber's zeal
for the <i>Conscious Lovers</i> was an obliging favour and
friendship to him, but he was referring to Cibber's care
in instructing the actors, &amp;c. Cibber did make several
alterations in the play before it was acted, but to its disadvantage,
and therefore he did not pay Cibber anything
for his meddling. The piece ran eighteen nights, and
brought £2,536 3s. 6d. to the house, but how much was
paid for charges and how much to him Steele could not
say, save £329 5s. or thereabouts, which he received
for three author's benefit nights. He could not set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
forth particular passages altered by Cibber; if he did,
it might run him, in vindication of his own performance,
into a sort of criticism very improper, as he
apprehended, for the entertainment of that Honourable
Court.</p>

<p>In October and November 1727, publication in the
original cause was twice enlarged, upon the petition of
the defendants, and on the 3rd February 1728, upon the
original cause coming before the Court, the defendants'
counsel alleged that the counter action was ready for
hearing, but that as Steele lived at Carmarthen the
plaintiffs in that action had not had time to serve him
with a subpœna to hear judgment; and they said that
both causes were proper to be heard together. Whereupon
it was ordered that the original cause should stand
over to the fourth day of causes after the term, and that
judgment should then be pronounced in both causes.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
The combined suits accordingly came to a hearing before
Sir Joseph Jekyll, Master of the Rolls, on Saturday night,
the 17th February 1728, at the Rolls Chapel,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> when
Cibber addressed the Court, acting upon the advice of
his counsel, who pointed out that he could speak better
upon the question of the business of a manager than the
most learned lawyer. Two of the counsel for Steele
afterwards held the post of Lord Chancellor, and Cibber
professes to have almost broken down with nervousness;
but he succeeded, with the help of notes, in making a
successful speech of an hour's length, which he has
printed at length in the sixteenth chapter of his <i>Apology</i>.
He maintained that Steele was as much obliged to do the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
duty and business of a manager as either Wilks, Booth,
or Cibber; and the reason why he had ceased to take
any part in the management was, that he was annoyed at
his fellow-managers, who had often helped him when he
was in want of money, but who found it necessary at last
to peremptorily refuse to advance another shilling until it
was due to him. After that Steele not only absented
himself, but made an assignment of his share, without the
consent of the others, in breach of their Agreement,
thereby exposing them to the chance of trouble and inconvenience.
His absence, too, had led to more than
proportionate loss, because his rank, and figure in the
world, and the ready access which he had at Court, had
been of great service; that was, in fact, the very end and
consideration of his share in the profits. Cibber proceeded
to argue that he, Wilks, and Booth had been
justified in charging £1 13s. 4d. a day for their extraordinary
labour, in Steele's absence, by graphically
describing the multitude of duties and disagreeable tasks
which fell to a manager's lot. Steele had not written
plays for nothing, and though, said Cibber, in writing
<i>The Conscious Lovers</i>, "he had more assistance from one
of the managers than becomes me to enlarge upon, of
which evidence has been given upon oath by several of
our actors, yet, Sir, he was allowed the full and particular
profits of that play as an author, which amounted to three
hundred pounds, besides about three hundred more
which he received as a joint sharer of the general profits
that arose from it." Cibber adds, in another place, that
when they told Steele of the salary they meant to take
for themselves in future, Steele only remarked that he
had no reason to doubt of their doing him justice,
and he never complained for nearly three years; indeed
it was not until his affairs were put into the hands
of lawyers and trustees that his lawyer thought that
here was a fair field for an action in Chancery, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
which, whatever the result might be, his bill would be
paid.</p>

<p>After hearing Cibber, and the counsel on both sides,&mdash;the
proceedings lasted five hours,&mdash;the Master of the
Rolls declared that he saw no good cause for breaking
through the account dated 18th June 1723, or for varying
the allowances of £1 13s. 4d. which had been made at
that time to each of the defendants, Wilks, Cibber, and
Booth. He therefore ordered that the account dated the
18th June 1723 should stand, and that it should be
referred to Mr. Bennett to take an account of the profits
of the theatre from that time; the defendants were to
produce before the said Master upon oath all books of
account, &amp;c., and to be examined as the Master should
direct; and in taking the account the Master was to
make to the defendants all just allowances. His Honour
declared he conceived the allowance of £1 which had
been already made to each of the defendants for management
every night was a reasonable allowance, and that
they ought to have this allowance continued to them
until Steele should come into the management of the
theatre; but the Master must determine what the defendants
respectively deserved for their charges for wigs,
lace, and linen, for which Steele admitted by his answer
that an allowance should be made; and he was also to
take an account of what was due to Woolley for principal
and interest on his mortgage, and to tax Woolley's costs
in this suit. The Master was also to ascertain what would
be coming to Steele for his fourth part of the profits on
the balance of the account, and from what was certified as
due to Steele, Wilks, Cibber, and Booth should pay to
Woolley what was reported due to him in the first place
for principal, interest, and costs as aforesaid, and should
pay the remainder to Scurlock for the uses mentioned
in the deed of assignment from Steele to Scurlock, or to
whoever Scurlock should authorise to receive the same;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
and Wilks, Cibber, and Booth were hereby indemnified
for so doing; and they were to continue to pay Steele's
fourth part of the growing profits, under such allowances
as aforesaid, to Steele or to whoever he should authorise
to receive the same. And it was further ordered that
Steele and Scurlock's bill against Castleman be dismissed
out of the court; and that no costs be paid to either of
the said parties, except to Woolley.</p>

<p>The Master's Report is dated July 10, 1728.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Mr.
Bennett said that the plaintiffs' solicitors having allowed
Wilks, Cibber, and Booth 13s. 4d. apiece for every day a
play was acted, from the 18th June 1723, as the same
had been allowed up to that time, he had taken an
account of Steele's fourth part of the profits from the said
18th June to the present time, and found that that fourth
part amounted to £2,692 3s. 3d., in discharge whereof
he found that the said defendants had paid to Steele or
order several sums, amounting to £1,601 3s. 3d., leaving
due to Steele £1,091. And the clerk in court for
Woolley had admitted that Woolley had been already
paid off and discharged all the principal and interest due
to him on Steele's account; and the Master had already,
by his Report of the 5th instant, taxed Woolley's bill of
costs at £29 2s. 10d., which sum he appointed Wilks,
Cibber, and Booth to pay Woolley out of the said sum
of £1,091 in their hands, and the residue, £1,061
17s. 2d., they were to pay to Scurlock, as directed by
the order of the 17th February. On the following day,
July 11, 1728, upon motion made by the counsel for the
defendants in the original cause, this Report and all contained
therein was confirmed by order and decree of the
Court.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

"To beseech gracefully, to approach respectfully, to pity, to
mourn, to love, are the places wherein Wilks may be said to shine
with the utmost beauty!" He had "a singular talent in representing
the graces of nature" and "the easy frankness of a gentleman."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a>  Contemporary writers loudly complained of the neglect of
ordinary plays at this time, owing to the importation of French
tumblers and rope-dancers, performing animals, and Italian singers.
"The town ran mad," says Gildon (<i>Comparison between the two
Stages</i>), after some of these entertainments. The theatres in Drury
Lane and Lincoln's Inn Fields tried to outdo each other in every
new attempt made by either of them. The "Celebrated Virgin,"
in a machine, shining in a full zodiac, and "Harlequin and Scaramouch,"
with plenty of grimaces and table-jumping, were favourite
amusements. The cleverest plays would rarely secure a reasonable
audience unless they were accompanied by dances, songs, and
clowns. Colley Cibber (<i>Apology</i>, chap. x), says that Rich paid
"extraordinary prices to singers, dancers, and other exotic performers,
which were as constantly deducted out of the sinking
salaries of his actors." The majority of the people "could more
easily apprehend anything they <i>saw</i>, than the daintiest things that
could be said to them." Rich was only prevented bringing an
elephant on to the stage by "the jealousy which so formidable a
rival had raised in his dancers," and by the bricklayers assuring him
that the safety of the building would be imperilled. The complaint
that what pleases is "the skill of carpenter, not player," is exactly
what we hear continually at the present day.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> An Order of the Lord Chamberlain to the Managers of the
Haymarket and Drury Lane Theatres, dated 24 Dec., 1709, directed
that all agreements with actors, &amp;c., were to be submitted to the
Lord Chamberlain; that all players were to be sworn in; that all
new plays, &amp;c., were to be re-licensed by the Master of the Revels;
and "that from and after the first day of January next no new
Representations be brought upon the Stage which are not Necessary
to the better performance of Comedy or Opera, such as ladder-dancing,
antic postures, &amp;c., without my leave and approbation
first had." (Lord Chamberlain's Records, Warrant Book No. 22,
end). See <i>Tatler</i>, Nos. 12, 99. The author of a book called
<i>The Antient and Modern Stages surveyed</i> (1699), attributed to
Dr. James Drake, and written in reply to Collier's <i>Short View</i>,
says (p. 99): "As for the dancing, which he calls bold, it may in
one sense be allowed him; for it must be granted that he that
ventures his neck to dance upon the top of a ladder is a very bold
fellow."</p></div>

Mr. E. Wortley Montagu, Lady Mary Pierrepoint says: "People
talk of being in love just as widows do of affliction. Mr. Steele has
observed in one of his plays, 'the most passionate among them have
always calmness enough to drive a hard bargain with the upholders.'
I never knew a lover that would not willingly secure his interest as
well as his mistress; or, if one must be abandoned, had not the
prudence (among all his distractions) to consider that a woman was
but a woman, and money was a thing of more real merit than the
whole sex put together."</p></div>

dwelt on the fine touches of humanity in the part of Trusty in this

obliged the dead to be buried in woollen, was to protect homespun
goods against foreign linen.

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"'Odious! in woollen! 'twould a saint provoke,'</span><br />

Pope here alludes, says Carruthers, to Mrs. Oldfield, who acted
Narcissa in Cibber's <i>Love's Last Shift</i>. She was buried in Westminster
Abbey, the corpse being decorated with "a Brussels lace
head-dress, a Holland shift, with tucker and double ruffles of the
same lace, and a pair of new kid gloves."&mdash;See, too, <i>Tatler</i>,
No. 118.
</p>
<p>
It is evident that by making a certain payment persons of position
could evade the Act; in the Overseers' Rate Books for the Parish
of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, one or two persons in the year are
often mentioned as being buried in linen: Thus in the volume for
1702 (p. 147) I found&mdash;

<p>
Mr. Austin Dobson has pointed out that if Anne Oldfield really
gave the orders alleged by Pope she was only elaborating the words
of Steele's widow, which she must have often heard on the stage,
as she acted the part of Lady Sharlot in this play.</p></div>

Sable says: "There's a what d'ye call, a crisis." In 1714, Steele

the Royal Society held its annual dinners until 1746. Pontack was
son of the President of the Parliament of Bordeaux, and gave the
name to a famous French claret. Evelyn refers to him in his
diary, 13 July, 1683, and 30 Nov., 1694, and Swift, in his Journal,
16 Aug., 1711: "Pontack told us, although his wine was so good,
he sold it cheaper than others; he took but seven shillings a flask.
Are not these pretty rates?" See, too, the prologue to <i>Love's
Contrivances</i>, 1703, by Mrs. Centlivre:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"At Locket's, Brown's, and at Pontack's enquire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What modish kickshaws the nice beaus desire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What famed ragouts, what new-invented salad,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Has best pretensions to regale the palate.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We hope 'twill please, 'cause like your bills of fare."</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Pontack put up a picture of his father's head as a sign (Burn's
<i>Descriptive Catalogue of the London Traders' Tavern, and Coffee-House
Tokens</i>, 1855, p. 13). From a tract called <i>The Metamorphoses
of the Town</i>, dated 1730, we learn that Pontack's was then
the resort of extravagant epicures; in the bill of fare of a "guinea
ordinary" are "a ragout of fatted snails," and "chickens not two
hours from the shell."</p></div>

on the site of the present Adelphi. It was a very favourite place
of resort in Charles II.'s time, and the restoration plays are full of
allusions to it. There were four walks, two above and two below
stairs. Steele refers to the New Exchange again in the <i>Spectator</i>,
Nos. 96, 155. It was pulled down in 1737. With the scene here
described we may compare Etherege's <i>She would if she could</i>,
III. i.:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"<i>Mrs. Trinckit.</i> What d'ye buy? what d'ye lack, gentlemen?
Gloves, ribbons, and essences; ribbons, gloves, and essences?...
</p>
<p>
"<i>Courtall.</i> Walk a turn or two above, or fool awhile with pretty
Mistress Anvil, and scent your eye-brows and periwig with a little
essence of oranges, or jessamine."
</p>
<p>
Similarly in Otway's <i>Atheist: or the Second Part of the Soldier's
Fortune</i>, II. i., Courtine remarks:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Methinks, this place looks as if it were made for lovings. The
lights on each hand of the walk look stately; and then the rustling
of silk petticoats, the din and the clatter of the pretty little parti-coloured
parrots, that hop and flutter from one side to t'other, puts
every sense upon its proper office, and sets the wheels of nature
finely moving."</p></div>

of a dialogue between two servants, Parmeno and Pythias&mdash;names
taken, no doubt, from Terence's <i>Eunuchus</i>. The pair discuss the
charm of the soft moments of servants in love, free from their usual
restraints. Why should any man usurp more than his share of the
atmosphere? The whole art of a serving-man is "to be here and
there, and everywhere, unheard and unseen till you are wanted,
and never absent when you are. This gives our masters and
mistresses the free room and scope to do and act as they please&mdash;they
are to make all the bustle, all the show&mdash;we are like convenient
demons or apparitions about 'em, never to take up space or fill the
air nor be heard of or seen but when commanded." Pythias remarks
how much she learns from Parmeno's conversation, and produces a
little collation from the last night's supper which she has prepared
for him. Parmeno eats the eggs, gorges, sings a song, and says
kind things between whiles to Pythias.</p></div>

June 20, 1713:&mdash;"I happened the other day to pass by a gentleman's
house, and saw the most flippant scene of low love that I
have ever observed. The maid was rubbing the windows within
side of the house, and her humble servant the footman, was so
happy a man as to be employed in cleaning the same glass on the
side towards the street. The wench began with the greatest
severity of aspect imaginable, and breathing on the glass, followed
it with a dry cloth; her opposite observed her, and fetching a deep
sigh, as if it were his last, with a very disconsolate air did the same
on his side of the window. He still worked on and languished,
until at last his fair one smiled, but covered herself, and spreading
the napkin in her hand, concealed herself from her admirer, while
he took pains, as it were, to work through all that intercepted their
meeting. This pretty contest held for four or five large panes of
glass, until at last the waggery was turned into an humorous way
of breathing in each other's faces, and catching the impression.
The gay creatures were thus loving and pleasing their imaginations
with their nearness and distance, until the windows were so
transparent that the beauty of the female made the man-servant
impatient of beholding it, and the whole house besides being abroad,
he ran in, and they romped out of my sight."</p></div>

Middlesex in these words: Whereas Christopher Rich, Esq., in
our Court at Westminster by our writ and by judgment of the said
Court recovered against Richard Steele, gentleman, <i>alias</i> Richard
Steele of the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, gentleman, £144
of debt, also 53s. for his damages, whereof Richard is convicted as
is manifest to us by the Records: Now on the part of the said
Christopher we understand that in spite of the judgment aforesaid
the debt and damages still remain unpaid, wherefore Christopher
prays us to give him a suitable remedy. We willing to do what is
just in the matter command you by honest men of your bailiwick
to cause Richard to know that he is to come before us at Westminster
on Wednesday next after the Quindene of Easter to show
if he knows or can say anything in bar of execution why Christopher
may not have execution of his debt and damages, according
to the force, form, and effect of recovery, if he shall think proper,
and further to do and receive what the Court shall consider to be
just in the matter.&mdash;On the 12th February, 5 Anne (1706-7), at Westminster,
Christopher came, and the Sheriff acknowledged that
Richard has nothing in his bailiwick by which he could cause him
to know, &amp;c. [<i>i.e.</i>, he had no property to which he could affix the
notice]. Richard did not come; therefore it was commanded to
the Sheriff to make known to him that he was to be before the
Queen at Westminster on Wednesday next after the month of
Easter, to show if, &amp;c., and further, &amp;c. The same day was given
to Christopher, whereupon he came, and the Sheriff again acknowledged
that Richard had nothing, &amp;c., but Richard did not come.
It was therefore considered that Christopher might have execution
against him of debts and damages, according to the form and effect
of the recovery aforesaid (Queen's Bench Judgment Roll, Easter
6 Anne, 375). I have not found the original judgment here

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
